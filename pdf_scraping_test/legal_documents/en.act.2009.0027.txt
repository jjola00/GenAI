gages of land.

compliance with the terms on which the mortgagor would be entitledto require a discharge, require the mortgagee, instead of dischargingthe mortgage, to assign the mortgage debt and transfer the mortgageto any third person, as the mortgagor directs, and on the mortgagorso directing, the mortgagee is bound to assign and transferaccordingly.

Act2009 .
(a) an order for the taking of an account of other incumbr-

gage as the court thinks appropriate.

not include a claim made in an action to a judgment debtor’s estateor interest in land (including such an estate or interest which a personreceives, whether in whole or in part, by an order made in the action)whether by way of claim or counterclaim in the action, unless the
claim seeks an order—
(a) under the Act of 1976, the Act of 1995 or the Act of
1996, or
(b) specifically against that estate or interest in land.
(5) Section 74 applies to a voluntary conveyance of land made by
the judgment debtor before the creditor registers a judgment mort-gage against that land under section 116 as if the creditor were a
purchaser for the purposes of section 74 .
118.—Registration in the Registry of Deeds of a certificate of satis-
faction of a judgment in respect of which a judgment mortgage hasbeen registered extinguishes the judgment mortgage.
119.—Section 32 of the Act of 1957 is amended by the addition of
the following subsection:
“(3) In the case of a judgment mortgage, the right of action
accrues from the date the judgment becomes enforceable andnot the date on which it is registered as a mortgage.”.

TI´OLACHTA 2009
LAND AND CONVEYANCING LAW REFORM ACT 2009
————————
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
————————
Introduction
This Act provides for a comprehensive reform and modernisation
of land law and conveyancing law. It is the result of a joint projectundertaken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reformand the Law Reform Commission. The first phase of the projectconcluded in October 2004 with publication of a Consultation Paperentitled ‘‘Reform and Modernisation of Land Law and Conveyanc-ing Law’’ (LRC CP 34 — 2004). This was followed by a consultationphase. The third phase culminated in publication of a Reportcontaining a draft Land and Conveyancing Bill in July 2005(LRC 74 — 2005).
The reforms contained in the Act are underpinned by the
following set of guiding principles:
(a) updating the law to make it accord with changes in society;
(b) promoting simplification of the law and its language to make
it more easily understood and accessible;
(c) promoting simplification of the conveyancing process,
especially the procedures involved and the taking ofsecurity over land;
(d) facilitating extension of the registration of title system with
a view to promoting its use; and
(e) facilitating introduction of an eConveyancing system as soon
as possible.
The Act provides for the repeal — in whole or in part — of about
150 pre-1922 statutes and their replacement, where appropriate, withstatutory provisions more suited to modern conditions. It also repealscertain provisions in Acts of the Oireachtas which will no longer berequired following its enactment.
Apart from these statutory provisions, much current law and prac-
tice relating to land ownership and land transactions is based on thesystem introduced to Ireland by the Normans from the 12th century
1Click  here  for Act2onwards. A key feature was the feudal notion of land tenure whereby
all land was held from the Crown. The Act abolishes feudal tenurein so far as it survives and updates the law relating to land ownership.It also abolishes various common law rules resulting from courtdecisions and conveyancing practices over the centuries.
Another significant feature of land and conveyancing law as it has
evolved has been the development of equitable jurisdiction by thecourts in order to temper the harshness or rigidity of the commonlaw. This has led to the important distinction between ‘‘legal’’ owner-ship of land and ‘‘equitable’’ or, as it is often referred to, ‘‘beneficial’’ownership. A good illustration of this distinction is the trust underwhich the legal title to property is vested in a trustee (or trustees)who is obliged to hold or use the property entirely for the benefit ofothers, i.e. the ‘‘beneficiaries’’. Under the Act’s provisions, the courtswill remain free to exercise their equitable jurisdiction to develop thelaw in order to accommodate changing circumstances and conditions.
While this Act introduces many changes to the common law relat-
ing to land ownership and land transactions, it recognises that it willotherwise continue to operate and to develop. A consequence of thisis that well-established concepts which are still of relevance in mod-ern times are retained, though often subject to modifications set outin the Act and explained later. The marginal notes which appearalongside various provisions throughout the Act indicate that theprovision concerned replaces an existing statutory provision eitherby retaining its substance or by modifying it.
Provisions of the Act
PART 1
PRELIMINARY AND GENERAL
(Sections 1 to8)
Sections 1 to8contain provisions of a general nature dealing with
such matters as commencement, interpretation, service of notices,regulations, offences and repeals.
Section 2 makes provision for different parts of the Act to be
implemented at different times.
Section 3 adapts or adopts definitions to be found in various
statutes relating to land and conveyancing, including statutes beingreplaced such as the Conveyancing Act 1881 and the Settled LandAct 1882. In one instance a definition differs from the one to befound in the Interpretation Act 2005. This is the definition of ‘‘land’’which is given an extended meaning. It makes it clear that landincludes both the airspace above and substratum below the surfaceand layers of these, however the division is made. It has becomeincreasingly common in modern times for transactions to be enteredinto with respect to such airspace before any buildings are erectedto fill the airspace. The definition confirms that such transactions arevalid (as was recognised by the common law in cases decided over acentury ago).
Section 4 provides for service of notices under this Act, e.g. notices
by a mortgagee requiring payment of mortgage money under section
100(1)(a) or giving particulars of a sale under section 103(2) . Under
section 85 , these provisions may also be applied to the service of
notices required by private documents, unless the document in ques-tion provides otherwise.Section 5 provides for the making of regulations to deal with pre-
scribed matters or otherwise generally to give effect to the Act.
Section 6 provides for offences such as fraudulent concealment of
title documents or falsification of a title under section 60 .
Section 8 provides for consequential amendments of other statutes
(set out in Schedule 1 ), other than certain amendments to the Regis-
tration of Title Act 1964 which are included in Part 13. Apart fromthe amendments set out in Schedule 1 ,subsection (2) deals with pro-
visions in statutes cross-referring to some statutes being repealed by,but with replacement provisions being contained in, this Act. Theseare the Conveyancing Acts 1881 to 1911 and the Settled Land Acts1882 to 1890. Under subsection (2) , such cross-references are to be
read as referring to the equivalent or substituted provision in thisAct. Section 8 also provides for the repeal of the numerous pre-1922
statutes set out in Schedule 2 . This also repeals some provisions in
post-1922 Acts of the Oireachtas.
PART 2
OWNERSHIP OF LAND
(Sections 9 to14)
Sections 9 to14contain provisions to reform and modernise the
ownership of land. They remove the remaining vestiges of the oldfeudal system of landholding introduced by the Normans to Irelandin the 12th century. In particular, the concept of tenure, wherebyall land was held from the Crown, is abolished. This concept is notcompatible with the relationship between the State and its citizensas prescribed by the Constitution. Also abolished are methods oflandholding developed by conveyancers over the centuries to meetthe needs of earlier times but which are no longer of relevance tomodern conditions or will cease to be of significance as a result ofother provisions of the Act. This applies to creation of a fee tail, feefarm grants and leases for lives.
The Act retains the concept of an ‘‘estate’’ in land which was also
part of the feudal system, because this remains a central feature ofthe modern system of land ownership. The notion of dividing owner-ship according to different periods of time is what makes land owner-ship under a common law system flexible. It enshrines the fundamen-tal principle that what is owned is not the physical entity, the land,but rather some estate (giving substantial rights in respect of the landsuch as the right to occupy it) or interest (giving less substantial rightssuch as the limited use given by an easement comprising, forexample, a right of way over a road on the land, or a profit a `prendre
comprising a right to cut and take away turf) in the land. The fullownership of any particular parcel of land comprises these variousestates and interests, including equitable interests, such as thoseexisting under a trust of the land. Article 10.1 of the Constitutionrefers expressly to ‘‘estates and interests’’ (in the context of naturalresources). How many of the various estates and interests will existin respect of a particular parcel of land will vary from case to case.As part of its objective of simplifying the law, the Act reduces sub-stantially the number of estates which can be created in future.
Ownership and abolition of feudal tenure
Section 9 abolishes the feudal concept of tenure but preserves the
concept of estates and interests in land as described above. Whatthese estates and interests are is specified in sections 10 to14. Further
34provisions relating to particular estates and interests are contained
in Parts 3 to 11 of the Act. Subsection (3) makes it clear that the
abolition of feudal tenure does not affect connected matters whichremain of relevance in modern times. Thus the position of the Stateas regards State property under the State Property Act 1954 (forwhich provision is made by Article 10 of the Constitution), and asultimate intestate successor to a deceased person’s property undersection 73 of the Succession Act 1965, is preserved.
Also preserved is a principle which was enshrined in an early
feudal statute which was applied to Ireland by Poyning’s Act 1495,the Statute Quia Emptores 1290. This is usually referred to as the
rule against inalienability and it means that the owner of the largest‘‘freehold’’ estate, the fee simple, is free to dispose of it. Thisprinciple, which contrasts with the position of the owner of a ‘‘lease-hold’’ estate, i.e. a tenant in the modern sense who is usually subjectto some restriction on alienation, has been invoked in and appliedby the Irish courts in recent times: see Re Dunne’s Estate [1988]
IR 155. Section 12 prohibits the future creation of a fee farm grant,
a type of grant which became particularly common in Ireland. Inessence it involved the grant of a freehold estate (a fee simple) sub-ject to (potentially) a perpetual rent (i.e. one which would be payableso long as the fee simple, which is the largest estate recognised bythe law, lasted). However, section 12 does not affect existing fee farm
grants, which comprise several categories. One of the common categ-ories developed in earlier times in Ireland was a grant involvingfeudal tenure. Such grants were prohibited by the Statute QuiaEmptores 1290 but it was the practice of the Crown when makinggrants of Irish land in the sixteen and seventeenth centuries to do so‘‘non obstante Quia Emptores’’, i.e. in derogation of the statutoryprohibition. Numerous Acts of the Irish Parliament in the seven-teenth century confirmed such grants and because some of them maysurvive, subsection (3) contains a saving for them. It also contains a
saving for customary rights or franchises (such as the right to hold afair or to run a ferry) which were commonly granted by the Crownin earlier times and a few of which may survive. Article 10 of theConstitution again refers to ‘‘franchises’’.
Estates and interests in land
Section 10 confirms that the concept of ‘‘estates’’ and ‘‘interests’’
is being retained as denoting the nature and extent of land owner-ship. As explained earlier, this is the fundamental principle of owner-ship under the common law system which applies to Ireland andmany other parts of the world, but which distinguishes it from civillaw systems which apply elsewhere. It also confirms that estates willretain their long-established characteristics apart from any derivedfrom the concept of tenure. This is, however, subject to the otherprovisions of the Act, which introduce substantial changes. Apartfrom the prohibition on future creation of fee farm grants introducedbysection 12 ,section 13 prohibits the future creation of a fee tail and
converts most existing ones into a fee simple. Under Part 4 of theAct, in future the other ‘‘freehold’’ estate recognised by the commonlaw, the life estate, will cease to be a legal estate and will, in future,confer an equitable interest only under a trust of the land (seesection 18(4) ).
Legal estates and interests
Section 11 elaborates upon sections 9 and 10by specifying the var-
ious estates and interests which in future can make up ownership ofland. The section is concerned primarily with legal ownership or titleto the land, but subsection (7) recognises that other interests maybecome recognised by the courts in exercise of their equitable juris-
diction. In recent times the courts have developed the equitable doc-trines of proprietary estoppel and constructive and resulting trusts,whereby a person who is the strict legal owner of land may beregarded as holding it subject to some equitable interest of anotherperson. Subsection (6) also confirms the existence of other equitable
estates or interests, which may or may not be the equivalent of thelegal ones specified in subsections (1) to(4).Subsection (1) confines
legal estates in future to the freehold and leasehold estates specifiedinsubsections (2) and (3). The only former ‘‘freehold’’ estate to con-
tinue as a legal estate is the largest one recognised by the commonlaw, and the nearest it ever came to recognising absolute ownership,the fee simple.
Ownership of land will remain subject to statutory limits. Under
section 73 of the Succession Act 1965, land may pass to the State asthe ultimate intestate successor, i.e. where the deceased owner failedto make a valid will disposing of the land, and so dies intestate, andhad no surviving relatives or next-of-kin capable of succeeding asintestate successors under the 1965 Act. Land may become the sub-ject of compulsory purchase under statutory powers conferred onpublic or other statutory bodies. Many restrictions on the develop-ment or use of land are imposed by statutes such as the Planning andDevelopment Act 2000. These powers and restrictions on ownershipall derive from statute and do not depend on any former Crownrights derived from the concept of tenure or, indeed, any rights ofthe State as successor to the Crown or under the Constitution. Theyare, therefore, not affected by the abolition of the concept of tenure.The other legal estate recognised is a leasehold estate which ariseswhen a tenancy in the modern sense of the relationship of landlordand tenant is created. Under section 3 of Deasy’s Act (the Landlordand Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland 1860) that relationship isbased on the parties’ contract or agreement and not on tenure. Suchtenancies remain extremely common in relation to both commercialand residential property and have been the subject of much legis-lation passed by the Oireachtas, such as the Landlord and TenantActs 1967 to 2009 and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 and 2009.The definition of ‘‘tenancy’’ in section 3 refers to the relationship of
landlord and tenant.
Since section 11 is concerned primarily with the legal title to land,
subsection (2) provides that it is a fee simple ‘‘in possession’’ only
which confers such title. If the fee simple is owned by a person ‘‘inreversion’’ or ‘‘in remainder’’, some other person will be entitled tosome interest in possession. For example, if X, the owner of a feesimple, grants a life estate to A, A has a life estate in possession andX has a fee simple reversion which will not fall into possession untilA dies. If, instead, X grants a life estate to A, with remainder to Bin fee simple, B has a fee simple remainder which again will notfall into possession until A dies. Both these dispositions are typicalsettlements of land which under current law attract the provisions ofthe Settled Land Acts 1882 to 1890. Those Acts are replaced by theprovisions in Part 4 under which the land will be held under a trust.
Under Part 4 the legal title, i.e. a fee simple in possession, will be
held by trustees on trust for, in the first example, A and X and, inthe second example, A and B. The interests of A (the life estate), X(the fee simple reversion) and B (the fee simple remainder) will allbe equitable or beneficial interests only. The trustees will be able todeal with the land, but only in the interests of the beneficiaries. Theidentity of the trustees is dealt with in section 19 .
56The Act recognises that in certain situations it is not appropriate
to impose the trust regime despite the fact that a fee simple held bya person is modified or qualified in some way. Subsection (2) lists
these cases, which all involve a relatively minor qualification on theownership of the fee simple. Paragraph (a) refers to a ‘‘determinable
fee’’ which is a fee simple subject to the possibility — and it is onlya possibility — that it may end prematurely, i.e. unlike an unqualifiedfee simple which potentially can last forever. An example would bea grant by X, owner of a fee simple, to A in fee simple until Dublinceases to be the capital city of Ireland. That event may never happenand the only interest which X has is a possibility of reverter, i.e. thepossibility that the event will occur, in which case the fee simple willrevert automatically to X. Because this is such a remote possibility,it is appropriate that A should be regarded as the real legal ownerof the land and there is little point in imposing a trust of the land insuch cases.
Paragraph (b) deals with a similar case, a ‘‘fee simple subject to a
right of entry or of re-entry’’. For example, X may grant a fee simpleto A, but include a condition that if Dublin ceases to be the capitalcity of Ireland, X or some other person may exercise a right of entryor re-entry. The nature of these rights is explained in section 3 .I n
essence, a right of entry is simply a right to retake possession for atemporary period (e.g. until some obligation is performed), whereasa right of re-entry is the right to take the land permanently, therebyforfeiting the previous owner’s estate or interest.
Paragraph (c) lists other cases where the fee simple is subject to
some minor qualification. Subparagraph (iii) refers to a ‘‘right of
residence’’ which is commonly granted to the spouse of a farmer whohas left the farm to a child. It has long been held by the Irish courtsthat in such cases the spouse does not have a substantial interest,such as a life estate, unless the right of residence is an exclusive onerelating to the entire farm. If it is, which would be a comparativelyrare case, then the farm should be regarded as settled on the spousefor life with remainder to the child in fee simple and the trusts pro-visions of Part 4 should apply. If, as is more common, the right ofresidence falls short of this, the child should be regarded as the legalowner, subject to a licence to occupy the farmhouse (or whateverpart of the farm the right of residence relates to), or a charge or lienowned by the spouse. Over the years the Irish courts have held thatthe nature of the interest under a right of residence varies accordingto the circumstances of the case. This distinction drawn between anexclusive right over the whole land and other rights of residence isalso drawn by section 81 of the Registration of Title Act 1964.
The other legal estate which will continue to be recognised is a
leasehold estate which arises when a ‘‘tenancy’’ is created. Thedefinition in s ection 3 makes it clear that this is the modern relation-
ship of landlord and tenant which, as mentioned earlier, undersection 3 of Deasy’s Act 1860 is based upon the contract of the par-ties and not on tenure. Subsection (3) makes it clear that most types
of tenancy created in modern times come within this concept, includ-ing, in particular, a tenancy for a fixed period of time and a ‘‘per-iodic’’ tenancy such as a weekly, monthly or yearly tenancy whichruns for successive periods until either party serves notice on theother to end it. Excluded, however, are the categories prohibited bysections 12 and 14.
Also excluded by the definition in section 3 are categories where
it has long been disputed whether they truly create the relationshipof landlord and tenant. One is a tenancy at will where the occupieroccupies the land entirely at the will of the owner who is entitled toevict the occupier at any time. The modern view is that such an
arrangement is more properly regarded as a mere licence to occupy.Apart from that, since usually no rent is payable (if it were, thearrangement would more likely be regarded as a periodic tenancy)the arrangement does not come within Deasy’s Act, section 3 ofwhich requires ‘‘consideration of any rent’’ for creation of therelationship of landlord and tenant. The other exclusion is a tenancyat sufferance which arises when a former tenant continues in occu-pation, without the agreement of the landlord, after the tenancy hasended. It has long been recognised that, notwithstanding the descrip-tion of this situation as a tenancy, the ‘‘tenant’’ is, in strict law, atrespasser subject to the law which applies to such a person.
Section 11(4) lists the various legal interests which may also be
owned, i.e. minor interests in respect of land which fall short of theestates in land (the fee simple in possession or a tenancy) whichconfer major rights in respect of the land, such as the right to possessor occupy it to the exclusion of other persons. These interests conferonly limited rights in respect of land which is owned by some otherperson or persons for some estate.
Paragraph (a) refers to an ‘‘easement’’ which is one of the most
common rights which an owner of land may have in respect of aneighbour’s land. What constitutes an easement has been the subjectof much case-law and the courts have made it clear that the rightswhich may be recognised as coming within the concept are notnecessarily closed. Well-established easements are a right of wayover a neighbour’s land, a right of support to a building provided bya neighbour’s land and a right to light to windows in a buildingcoming over a neighbour’s undeveloped land.
Paragraph (b) refers to a ‘‘freehold covenant’’, i.e. the right of
one fee simple owner to enforce a covenant (such as one requiringrepair of a wall or fence separating the properties or restricting theuse of land to private residential purposes) against a neighbour’sland. This area of the law is modified substantially by sections 48 to
50. Both paragraphs (a) and (b), and other paragraphs ( (f)and (h)),
refer to what are commonly referred to as ‘‘appurtenant’’ rights, i.e.they are rights which one landowner is entitled to exercise over landowned by a neighbour. As such they are appurtenant to the owner’sland, rather than the owner personally. Thus, when the landownertransfers his interest in the land to another person, the right over theneighbour’s land passes with the land to that other person who thenbecomes entitled to enforce the right. Conversely, if the landownerwhose land is subject to the rights transfers that land to anotherperson, the burden of those rights passes with the land and that otherperson becomes subject to them. The law relating to such‘‘appurtenant’’ rights is substantially modified in Part 8.
Paragraph (c) refers to an ‘‘incumbrance’’. The definition in
section 3 of the Act makes it clear that this covers the wide variety
of annuities, liens and other charges over land which may be createdin favour of other persons. For example, where land is settled on Afor life, with remainder to B in fee simple, and A and B are membersof the settlor’s family, various other members of the family may beprovided for by making A’s and B’s interests in the land subject tocharges like annuities (to provide an income) or portions (to providea capital sum).
The other main type of incumbrance is a mortgage providing
security for a loan made by a lending institution, like a bank or build-ing society. The law of mortgages is substantially modified in Part10. Another particular type of mortgage which is commonly created
78is a judgment mortgage registered by a judgment creditor against
the judgment debtor’s interest in land. The law relating to judgmentmortgages is substantially modified in Part 11.
Paragraph (d) refers to a ‘‘rent payable under a tenancy’’. The
right to receive such rent was long regarded as an interest owned bythe landlord distinct from the landlord’s reversion, e.g. the fee simplewhich will fall into possession when the tenancy ends. As such it maybe assigned to someone else, so that that person becomes entitled toreceive the rent, while the landlord retains the reversion and theright to enforce other provisions of the tenancy, such as repairingcovenants. Paragraph (e) refers to a ‘‘possibility of reverter’’. As
explained earlier in connection with the fee simple estate, this is whatis owned by the grantor of a determinable fee. Subsection (9) makes
it clear that such a possibility is an interest which may be disposedof to someone else.
Paragraph (f) refers to a ‘‘ profit a `prendre , including a mining
right’’. These, like easements, are amongst the most common rightswhich can be exercised in respect of someone else’s land. Often theytoo are ‘‘appurtenant’’ rights, but an important difference is that aprofit can also be owned ‘‘in gross’’, i.e. owned by a person who isnot a neighbouring landowner; indeed, a profit can be owned by aperson who owns no interest in any land other than the rights inrespect of the land which is subject to the profit. A profit a `prendre
is the right to go onto someone else’s land and to take from it some-thing which exists on it naturally. The well-established examples aremining rights, the right to cut turf (turbary), the right to graze ani-mals (pasture) and various sporting rights (to fish and hunt wildgame).
Paragraph (g) refers to a ‘‘public or customary right’’. A typical
example of a public right is a public right of way similar to an ease-ment. The difference is that the right of way is exercisable in thisinstance not just by a neighbouring landowner but by the generalpublic. Customary rights are usually enjoyed by people in a particularlocality, such as a right to use a park or recreational area.
Paragraph (h) refers to a ‘‘rentcharge’’, which is to be dis-
tinguished from rent payable under a tenancy. It arises where therent payable by a landowner is a charge on the land and no relation-ship of landlord and tenant exists between the person entitled to therent and the rentpayer. Such rentcharges used to be created as partof a settlement of land and some arose under statutory provisions.They are rarely created nowadays and section 41 largely prohibits
their future creation. However, paragraph (h) is a saving for existing
ones and new ones which may be created in the future under, e.g.a statute.
Paragraph (i) refers to a ‘‘right of entry or of re-entry attached to
a legal estate’’. The nature of such rights, which are defined in section
3, was explained earlier in connection with the fee simple estate, but
it should be noted that they may also attach to a tenancy. A right ofre-entry is invariably reserved by a landlord for breach of covenantby the tenant. Paragraph (j) refers to a ‘‘wayleave or other right to
lay cables, pipes, wires or other conduits’’. Such rights are commonlyowned by utility bodies providing services like the supply of elec-tricity, gas and water. Paragraph (k) is a residuary provision which
permits the creation of other rights by statute.
Subsection (5) makes it clear that, subject to modifications made
by this Act, the various legal estates and interests retain their well-established attributes. It also confirms what has always been the case,namely, that different persons may own different estates and
interests at the same time or in succession in respect of the sameland.
Subsection (8) confirms that powers which persons may have to
dispose of interests in land, such as a power of attorney or power ofappointment, continue to operate as before following enactment ofthis Act.
Subsection (9) clarifies the law by providing that all estates and
interests in land, whether legal — as listed in subsections (1) and (4)
—or equitable, may be disposed of. In the past doubts have been
expressed as to whether this applied to something like a possibilityof reverter on the ground that it comprised only a ‘‘possible’’ interestrather than an ‘‘actual’’ one.
Fee farm grants
Section 12 prohibits the future creation of fee farm grants. Such
grants involve the grant of a fee simple subject to payment of a per-petual (fee farm) rent. As such they confuse the nature of a freehold(without a rent) estate and leasehold (with a rent) estate. They wereonce very common and different categories have been created overthe centuries. The definition in section 3 includes all these categories.
Mention was made earlier of feudal grants made out of land grantedby the Crown ‘‘non obstante Quia Emptores’’. Other grants involvedcreation of a rentcharge. Since the 19th century most grants involvedcreation of the relationship of landlord and tenant under Deasy’sAct or resulting from conversion of leases for lives or years understatutes like the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act 1849. Suchgrants are rarely created nowadays and usually only because it isdesired to make covenants bind freehold land on the basis of lease-hold law. The need for this is removed in sections 48 to50and so, in
the interests of simplifying the law, the future creation of fee farmgrants is prohibited. This accords with the policy laid down by theOireachtas in ground rents legislation which prohibits the grantingof leases of dwellings at a ground rent and confers the right on les-sees to acquire the fee simple. The definition of ‘‘fee simple’’ in thislegislation made it clear that the prohibition on leases covers feefarm grants and that a fee farm grantee may use the legislation tobuy out the rent and become relieved of covenants in the grant.
Subsection (2) provides that any attempt to create a fee farm grant
in future will fail and will instead vest a fee simple in the grantee,which, under subsection (3) , will not be subject to any rent. However,
it will be subject to any covenants or provisions which are consistentwith such a fee simple such as covenants rendered enforceable insection 49 .Paragraph (b) ofsubsection (2) is included because the
Act repeals the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act 1849. Section37 of that Act provided that any post-1849 lease for lives or yearsperpetually renewable automatically operated as a fee farm grant.With its repeal, it is necessary to make provision for the effect of anysuch lease granted after the commencement of section 12 .Subsection
(4)contains a saving for any contract to make a grant entered into
before that commencement.
Subsection (5) makes it clear that despite the prohibition on the
creation of any new fee farm grants, any fee simple held under a feefarm grant already existing at the commencement of the Act willcontinue as a legal estate and may be disposed of.
910Subsection (6) provides a saving for existing fee farm rents. Such
rents are not listed amongst the legal interests that may be createdor disposed of in section 11(4) because that provision is concerned
with the future. While s ection 12 prohibits the future creation of fee
farm rents, subsection (5) provides that existing ones continue as
legal interests and may be disposed of notwithstanding that they arenot listed in section 11(4) .
Fee tail
Section 13 prohibits the future creation of a fee tail estate. This
was the product of the ancient Statute De Donis Conditionalibus1285 which was designed to enable feudal landowners to ensure thattheir land was passed down through generations of the same family.Such family settlements belong to a different era and their effective-ness was greatly reduced by later legislation such as the Fines andRecoveries (Ireland) Act 1834 which enabled an owner in tail to ‘‘barthe entail’’ by executing a ‘‘disentailing assurance’’ (thereby creatinga fee simple) and the Settled Land Acts 1882 to 1890 which gave anowner in tail the powers of a tenant for life to sell the fee simple.
Subsection (2) provides that any future attempts to create a fee
tail will instead create a fee simple. Subsection (3) converts most
existing fees tail into fees simple thereby achieving automaticallywhat the owner in tail could achieve by executing a disentailingassurance under the 1834 Act. The conversion of a fee tail into a feesimple will only take place where any protectorship (see below) hasended. This is intended to avoid interference with any existinginterest in the land. The analogy with the 1834 Act is carried forwardinsubsection (4) . Under the 1834 Act a barring of the entail was not
effective if the consent of the ‘‘protector’’ was not obtained. Theprotector was usually the owner of a prior interest in the land (butit could be someone else named in the grant), e.g. where the landhad been granted to A for life, remainder to B in fee tail, remainderto C in fee simple. So long as A was alive, B could not create a feesimple by executing a disentailing assurance unless A consented toit. Instead, the assurance could create only a ‘‘base fee’’ under whichthe successors to the fee tail would be barred but not the owner ofa remainder like C. Paragraph (a) preserves this position so long as
the protectorship exists, but once it ends, e.g. on the death of A, theautomatic conversion provisions of subsection (3) will apply. Those
provisions will also apply under paragraph (b) to the other category
of a base fee, often referred to as a ‘‘determinable’’ or ‘‘voidable’’one. This arises where the disentailing assurance has not beenenrolled within 6 months in the High Court as required by the 1834Act, a technicality which was often forgotten. The automatic conver-sion provisions would not apply, however, to the owner of a fee tail‘‘after possibility of issue extinct’’, often referred to as an‘‘unbarrable’’ entail. This arises where a fee tail ‘‘special’’ has beencreated, whereby the successors of the original owner must be thechildren of a specified spouse. If that spouse predeceases the originalowner of the fee tail and they have no children, the owner(notwithstanding that he or she may subsequently have children witha new spouse) becomes, in effect, the owner of a life estate only andon his or her death (since there are no successors to the fee tail) theperson entitled to the reversion or remainder following the fee tailmust succeed to the land. The owner of the fee tail after possibilityof issue extinct cannot execute an effective disentailing assurance.Subsection (4) recognises this and preserves the rights of the owner
of the reversion or remainder due to fall into possession on death ofthe owner of the fee tail.
Subsection (5) clarifies the effect of the automatic vesting of a fee
simple under subsection (2) (failed attempts to create a fee tail in thefuture) and subsection (3) (conversion of existing fees tail). Following
again the analogy of the effect of a valid disentailing assurance underthe 1834 Act, the interests of those entitled to reversions or remain-ders if the fee tail ever came to an end cease to exist. However,paragraph (b) provides that if the fee tail was subject to some modifi-
cation or qualification entitling some other person to take the land‘‘in defeasance’’ of the fee tail, and that provision would be valid ifattached to a fee simple, it will continue to attach to the fee simplevesting under subsections (2) or(3). An example of such a
‘‘defeasance’’ condition would be a grant to A in fee tail, but ifDublin ceases to be the capital city of Ireland, then to B in feesimple. The fee simple vesting in A under subsections (2) and (3)
would remain subject to the right of B to take it if the event specifiedoccurs. Section 11(2)(b) recognises that such a provision can attach
to a fee simple in possession.
Leases for lives
Section 14 prohibits the future creation of various categories of
leases for lives or for a combination of lives and a period of years.Such grants were once fairly common but are now obsolete. Theirprohibition facilitates simplification of the law. The Law ReformCommission took the view that they are so rare in modern times thatthere was no need for conversion provisions relating to any existing
ones. What few ones exist can be left to run their course.
PART 3
FUTURE INTERESTS
(Sections 15 to17)
Part 3 introduces a substantial simplification of the various rules
governing ‘‘future interests’’ in land and, in some cases, such interestsin other property. Future interests are interests which do not ‘‘vest’’in, i.e. come into the possession of, the persons entitled to them untilsome time in the future, usually because the land (or other property)is vested in someone else in the meantime. Examples already men-tioned are reversions and remainders which generally do not giverise to problems because there is no doubt that they will eventuallyvest in the person entitled; they are said to be vested ‘‘in interest’’pending their vesting ‘‘in possession’’.
The early common law had more difficulty with what are referred
to as ‘‘contingent’’ future interests where there was no vesting ‘‘ininterest’’ from the beginning because, in addition to prior interestshaving to run their course, some other condition had to be satisfiedor event had to occur before any vesting took place. The dispositioncould not vest even in interest unless and until that contingency hadbeen met. In early times the common law was concerned that thismight result in a period of time when the land would be vested inno-one and so feudal dues payable in respect of the land could notbe collected. This resulted in the development of complicated rulesdesigned to avoid such a gap or ‘‘abeyance’’ in what was referred toin feudal times as the ‘‘seisin’’ of the land. These rules were knownas the common law contingent remainder rules. Later, as settlementsand trusts of land (and of other property) became more and moresophisticated, the courts developed a range of other rules designedto restrict the ability of settlors to decree the ownership of propertyfar into the future. These were rules such as the Rule in Whitby v.
Mitchell and the rule against perpetuities.
1112The Law Reform Commission has concluded that all these rules
have served their purpose and that they now give rise to unnecessarycomplications in the law. Even worse, their application oftenthwarted the intentions of settlors and created a trap for them andtheir professional advisers. It recommended that the various rulesshould be abolished, but subject to an important qualification. Sincethe abolition of the various rules would enable future settlors tocreate settlements and trusts deciding the ownership of property farinto the future, there is a risk that future owners might find them-selves saddled with a scheme of ownership which is unsuitable. Inorder to provide a means whereby future generations might securea modification to a scheme set up many years previously, the Com-mission recommended that abolition of the rules relating to futureinterests should be accompanied by the enactment of provisions topermit the variation of trusts. This is provided for in Part 5.
Section 15 confirms, as explained earlier, that most future interests
in land will be equitable ones only, existing under a trust of landunder Part 4. There are, however, two exceptions to this. These area possibility of reverter and right of entry or re-entry attached to alegal estate. The point about these interests is that they can also existas legal interests and so are included in the list of such interests insection 11(4) .
Section 16 lists the various rules which are being abolished. As
regards paragraph (a) , apart from the fact that the original purpose
of the contingent remainder rules, i.e. the collection of old feudaldues, has long disappeared, the dangers of a gap in the ‘‘seisin’’ ortitle to land is removed under the Act. Under Parts 2 and 4, futureinterests, whether contingent or not, will in most cases be equitableinterests only because the legal title to the property — either a free-hold or leasehold estate — will always be vested in possession.Where a settlement or trust creates a succession of future interests,the legal title will be held by trustees and the future interests will beequitable only.
As regards paragraph (b) , the rule in Purefoy v. Rogers is an
arcane rule connected with the contingent remainder rules and itfalls with them. For the same reason, the Contingent RemaindersAct 1877 is repealed in Schedule 2 without any replacement. As
regards paragraphs (c) and (d), these are the later rules developed
by the courts to restrict settlors’ powers of disposition of not onlyland but also other property. Paragraph (e) concerns a rule which
was originally developed by the courts and then modified substan-tially by the Accumulations Act 1800. While that Act did not applyto Ireland, confusion arose because later amending legislation, theAccumulations Act 1892, did apply. The 1892 Act is being repealedwithout replacement.
Section 17 explains the scope of section 16 . In summary, the abol-
ition of the various rules listed in section 16 applies to existing settle-
ments and trusts subject to the important qualifications stated insection 17 . Those qualifications are designed to protect any person
whose position would be materially altered to that person’s detri-ment because of a distribution or other dealing with property orother actions or omissions committed in reliance on an interest beinginvalid by virtue of the application of any of the rules being abol-ished. The time for assessing whether a person has materially alteredhis or her position is after the abolition of the rules.PART 4
TRUSTS OF LAND
(Sections 18 to22)
This Part provides for a radical overhaul and considerable simplifi-
cation of the law relating to settlements and trusts of land. Manysettlements — which involve settling the ownership of the land forsuccessive generations, usually of the same family — do not involveuse of a trust. Instead, the land is given by a deed or will to differentpersons in succession, e.g. to A for life, remainder to B in fee simple.Sometimes a trust is used so that instead the land is given to trusteesto be held by them on trust for the successive beneficiaries. The typeof trust used may vary; one may require the trustees to hold on tothe land whereas another may be a trust ‘‘for sale’’ requiring thetrustees to sell the land at the earliest opportunity, invest theproceeds and hold those investments instead for the beneficiaries.
The law governing settlements and trusts had become complicated.
One reason is that while the Settled Land Acts 1882 to 1890 appliedto settlements without any trust (usually referred to as a ‘‘strictsettlement’’) and trusts to hold land, they did not apply in the sameway to trusts for sale. Part 4 clears up this confusion by replacing the1882 to 1890 Acts with a single and much more straightforward trust
of land scheme. An important aspect of this scheme is that the legaltitle to the land will always be vested in trustees and they will havefull powers of dealing with it and using it for the benefit of thebeneficiaries.
Section 18 specifies the various kinds of settlements and trusts
relating to land which will comprise a ‘‘trust of land’’ coming underPart 4. In essence, it covers every kind of settlement (whether or notthe instrument creating it creates an express trust), holding trusts andtrusts for sale whereby land is to be held for persons in successionto each other, and any other situation where land is subject to a trust,including a constructive or resulting trust declared by a court. It alsocovers the situation where land is owned by a minor which is alsothe position under the Settled Land Acts 1882 to 1890. The onlyexception to this rule is in subsection (9) . This is where land is held
directly for a charitable purpose. The view has been taken that thelaw relating to charities gives rise to special considerations and theyhave long been the subject of special legislation such as the CharitiesActs 1961 and 1973 and the Charities Act 2009.
Subsection (3) makes it clear that any trust of land is governed by
the general law of trusts, subject to Part 4. The general law comprisesthe body of law built up by the courts over the centuries relatingto, for example, trustees’ duties owed to beneficiaries (based on theprinciple that they must act always in the interests of the benefici-aries and not seek personal gain) and statute law, such as the pro-visions of the Trustee Act 1893 dealing with administration of trustsand trustees’ powers.
Subsection (4) makes it clear that the conversion of a life estate
into an equitable interest under a trust by section 11 and 15does not
affect a life owner’s liability for waste. The doctrine of waste wasdeveloped by the courts to protect the interests of persons entitledto succeed to land after a prior owner holding a limited interest likea life estate. It prohibits such a prior owner from damaging the prop-erty (laying waste to it) while he or she occupies it. Such an equitablelife owner may, under section 20(2) , be permitted by the trustees to
occupy or use the land.
1314Subsections (5) ,(6)and (7)re-enact the substance of the provision
in the Life Estates Act 1695 that, after a life owner has been unheardof for at least seven years, there is a presumption that he or she isdead and so it is safe to allow a successor to enjoy the land. Subsec-
tion (8) provides that any party to a conveyance is to be presumed
to have attained full age. Under section 18(1)(c) if the person in
question was a minor, a trust of that person’s interest in the landwould exist and the legal title to it would be vested in, and couldonly be disposed by, the trustees rather than the minor.
Section 19 specifies the identity of the trustees of the land
depending upon the different situations which will attract the pro-visions of Part 4. Where a strict settlement not involving an expresstrust exists at the commencement of Part 4, it will become a trustof land under section 18(1)(a) . However, in order to preserve some
continuity with the previous law governed by the Settled Land Act1882 (under which the tenant for life had limited powers of dealingwith the land, subject to an indirect role of trustees of thesettlement), section 19(1)(a) provides that the trustees will be the
tenant for life together with the trustees of the settlement. Where asettlement is created after the commencement of Part 4, it willinvolve a trust and the instrument creating it should specify the trus-tees. Paragraph (b) ofsubsection (1) lists in order of priority other
persons connected with the settlement or trust who may become thetrustees if none are specified by the instrument creating the trust,such as, in the case of a trust arising under a will, the testator’s per-sonal representatives. Paragraph (c) applies these provisions to cases
where a trust arises under Part 4 because the land is vested in aminor. Paragraph (d) deals with other trusts of land which do not
involve a settlement creating a succession of interests, such as a con-structive or resulting trust declared by a court or a bare trust (whereland is vested by the owner in a nominee). In all such cases theperson holding the legal title is the trustee.
Subsection (2) clarifies the provisions of subsection (1) while s ub-
section (3) confirms the usual ‘‘fallback’’ provision that as a last
resort an application can be made to court for appointment of atrustee.
Section 20 simplifies the law by removing the need to spell out in
detail the various powers of trustees. Instead, under subsection (1) ,
all the powers of an owner to convey or otherwise deal with theland are conferred on the trustees. Paragraphs (a) and (b), however,
contain very important qualifications on these powers. They are sub-ject to the duties of trustees, which, under the general law of trusts,are aimed at ensuring that the trustees always act in the interests ofthe beneficiaries. They are also subject to any restrictions imposedby statute law or the general law of trusts or any instrument or courtorder relating to the land. It will, therefore, remain open to futuresettlors or testators to impose restrictions on the trustees’ powers.
Subsection (2) clarifies the powers conferred by subsection (1) .
Paragraph (a) makes it clear that it will be open to the trustees to
permit a beneficiary to occupy or make other use of the land on suchterms as the trustees think fit. Their duties under the general law oftrusts to have regard to the interest of all the beneficiaries, and toact impartially towards them, might require them to considercharging the beneficiary a rent for such occupation or use or paymentof outgoings. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that it would be open to
the trustees to sell a property which is too large or unsuitable foroccupation by a beneficiary and to reinvest the proceeds in purchaseof a more suitable property. This might be a property outside theState so as to enable a beneficiary to live near a close or only relative.Section 21 clarifies and simplifies the position of a purchaser of
land from a trustee of any kind. This applies not only to the casewhere an express trust has been created but to any case where thelegal owner is holding the land subject to some equitable interest,such as one which a court would enforce by way of a constructiveor resulting trust or by application of an equitable doctrine such asproprietary estoppel.
Subsection (1) establishes the general rule of ‘‘overreaching’’, i.e.
that a purchaser from the trustee or legal owner gets a good title tothe land. This general rule is not affected by the fact that the pur-
chaser has notice of the equitable interest. As subsection (5) makes
clear, a consequence of ‘‘overreaching’’ is simply that the equitableinterests previously attaching to the land attach thereafter to the pro-ceeds of the conveyance of the land. Those proceeds will be in thehands of the trustee or trustees who will remain subject to the dutiesattaching under the general law of trusts to a trustee. The proceedswill have to be held, and usually invested on behalf of, the benefici-aries previously owning equitable interests in the land. This will notbe the concern of the purchaser of the land and in this way convey-ancing will be facilitated.
Subsection (2) clarifies when overreaching of equitable interests
operates in favour of a purchaser. In the case of express trusts,including where land is held for a minor, the conveyance must be byat least two trustees or a trust corporation, i.e. a corporationauthorised to act as a trustee (as provided for by section 30(4) of theSuccession Act 1965). This is designed to minimise the risk of aninappropriate disposal of the land. There are, however, other safe-guards in addition to the general duty of the trustees to act in theinterests of the beneficiary, breach of which can involve very severepenalties on the trustees personally. Any beneficiary, or otherinterested person, who objects to the actions of the trustees will beentitled to seek a court order under section 22 . Under subsection (3)
(a), no overreaching in favour of a purchaser will operate where the
conveyance is made for a fraudulent purpose of which the purchaserhad actual knowledge at the date of the conveyance or to which thepurchaser was a party. This would be particularly important wherethe conveyance is made by a single legal owner who may not be anexpress trustee (but would be regarded by a court as a constructiveor resulting one) or may be a nominee holding the land for a solebeneficial owner rather than one of a number of beneficiaries.
Paragraph (b) ofsubsection (3) lists other cases where no over-
reaching will occur. One is the obvious one where the conveyance ofthe land itself rules it out by expressly making it subject to the equit-able interest in question. Another is where the title documents havebeen deposited to protect the equitable interest so as to create aonce-common equitable mortgage of the land. The co-operation ofthe equitable mortgagee (to release the title documents) is usuallyrequired to facilitate any later conveyance of the land. Anotherrelates to the situation where there is no express trust or land heldfor a minor and so a conveyance may be made by a single legalowner, such as a constructive or resulting trustee. In such a casethe beneficiary or person entitled to claim an equitable interest mayprotect it by registration in the Registry of Deeds (in the case ofunregistered land) or Land Registry (in the case of registered land),as provided by subsection (4) . It is envisaged that the method of
registration will be prescribed by general rules under the Regis-tration of Title Act 1964 and the Registration of Deeds and TitleAct 2006.
1516The equitable interests of a person who is in actual occupation
of the land are dealt with in section 21(3)(b)(iii) . Section 72 of the
Registration of Title Act 1964, which provides that actual occupationis a burden affecting the land whether it is registered or not, isretained. The equitable interest of a person in actual occupation (orin receipt of the rent or profits) cannot be over-reached, even if thatinterest has not been registered in the Land Registry or the Registryof Deeds. The existing practice whereby an intending purchasermakes enquiries as to who is in actual occupation, or to whom rentis paid, will therefore continue.
The final safeguard against overreaching applies where the land is
a family home within the Family Home Protection Act 1976. Underthat Act a conveyance by the ‘‘owning’’ spouse (who has the legaltitle) must have the consent of the ‘‘non-owning’’ spouse (whetheror not he or she has an equitable interest). Subsection (6) preserves
that position.
Section 22 makes provision for resolution of disputes relating to
the various trusts of land coming under Part 4. This includes disputesbetween the trustees themselves, the beneficiaries themselves, thetrustees and beneficiaries or the trustees or beneficiaries and otherpersons interested in the trust. Subsection (4) makes it clear that
such other persons include mortgagees, other secured creditors orjudgment mortgagees. Subsection (1) provides that the courts’ juris-
diction, which is summary, relates to a wide variety of matters,including the trustees’ performance of their functions as trustees orother operation of the trust. It also covers the nature and extent ofany claimed beneficial or other interest in the land.
Subsection (2) confers a discretionary jurisdiction on the courts to
resolve such disputes, taking into account the matters listed in sub-
section (3) . These matters, which are subject to the interests of the
beneficiaries as a whole, include the purposes intended to beachieved by the trust and the interests of minors or of beneficiariessubject to any incapacity and of secured creditors of any beneficiary.Subsection (5) contains a saving for the longstanding jurisdiction of
the courts to determine questions relating to title to or possession ofproperty as between spouses, now to be found in section 36 of theFamily Law Act 1995.
PART 5
VARIATION OF TRUSTS
(Sections 23 and 24)
Part 5 makes specific statutory provision for the first time in Irish
law for the variation of trusts. The enactment of such a provisionwas recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its Reportson ‘‘The Rule against Perpetuities and Cognate Rules’’ and ‘‘TheVariation of Trusts’’.
With very limited exceptions, current law prohibits variations in
trusts. The first exception is known as the Rule in Saunders v.
Vautier . This may be invoked where the trust beneficiaries are of full
age and capacity and are entitled to the entire beneficial interest inthe trust. If they agree amongst themselves, they may terminate thetrust and direct that the trust property be distributed according totheir instructions. The courts are not involved.Secondly, under what is known as ‘‘salvage’’ jurisdiction, courts
have an inherent power to authorise a variation on behalf of benefici-aries who are not of full age and capacity where some unforeseenevent happens and it is necessary to authorise the trustees to takeaction to protect the trust property from destruction or damage. Forexample, a power of sale may be conferred in order to fund essentialrepairs to the trust property.
Thirdly, despite the fact that the trust instrument may direct that
income be accumulated, direct payments may be made in favour ofa needy infant beneficiary. The basis for this jurisdiction is that thecourts assume that the settlor does not intend that beneficiaries beleft without reasonable means. However, this power cannot be exer-cised in favour of a needy adult.
Finally, there is a ‘‘compromise’’ jurisdiction which arises where
there is a genuine dispute regarding interpretation of the trust instru-ment. Where a compromise is agreed between the beneficiaries offull age and capacity regarding interpretation, the court may consentto this on behalf of the remaining beneficiaries.
Against this background of very limited flexibility, the Law
Reform Commission recommended a more flexible approach inorder to meet legitimate needs where practical difficulties are enco-untered. Difficulties may arise, for example, when certain trusteepowers are left out of the trust instrument but are found to be neces-sary when the trust takes effect, e.g. the power to sell land or otherassets, or to continue running a business; some investment powerswhich are outside the limits set out in the Trustee Act 1893; powerto delegate. Another problem that arises is the failure adequately toidentify trustees in the trust instrument. According to the Com-mission, experience shows that there are many trusts which have notbeen well drafted, e.g. will-trusts may have had to be settled in ahurry, and which do not foresee the types of practical problems thatcan arise. Other factors which may give rise to the need to vary atrust are related to changes in family circumstances not foreseen bya settlor, e.g. a beneficiary who becomes frail or incapacitated mayrequire specialist care or sheltered accommodation rather than con-tinuing to reside in what was the family home.
To deal with this type of situation, while at the same time avoiding
undue interference with the settlor’s intentions, Part 5 provides thatany variation should be conditional on the court being satisfied thatit is for the benefit of a beneficiary who cannot or will not consentfor himself or herself.
Section 23 contains definitions for the purposes of Part 5. An
‘‘appropriate person’’ is a person who may make an application tothe court for a variation. Normally this would be a trustee or a ben-eficiary but the court may, if it considers it appropriate, permitanother person to make an application, e.g. a relative of an incapaci-tated beneficiary. The definition of ‘‘arrangement’’ gives the court awide discretion to respond to the circumstances giving rise to theapplication for the variation.
‘‘Relevant person’’ is the person for whose benefit a variation may
be sought. Four categories are recognised: a person who is incapableby reason of infancy or absence of mental capacity; an unborn per-son; a person whose identity, existence or whereabouts cannotreasonably be established; a person with a contingent interest underthe trust who is not an infant or under a disability, e.g. a recalcitrantadult beneficiary. The definition of ‘‘relevant trust’’ excludes bothcharitable and pension trusts.
1718Section 24 establishes the new court jurisdiction. Subsection (1)
permits an appropriate person, in respect of a relevant trust, to makean application to court for an order to approve an arrangement forthe benefit of a relevant person. The proposed arrangement musthave been assented to in writing by any other beneficiaries, excludingany ‘relevant persons’, who are capable of assenting.
Subsection (2) requires that written notice be served on the
Revenue Commissioners and notice parties prescribed by rules ofcourt at least 2 weeks before the hearing of the application.Subsection (3) permits the hearing of applications in camera .
Subsection (4) requires the court to approve the arrangement if it
is satisfied that the carrying out of the arrangement would be for thebenefit both of the relevant person specified in the application andany other relevant person. The latter is intended to ensure that theinterests of other beneficiaries, e.g. an unborn person, are not over-looked. The court may not approve an application in any case wherethese conditions are not fulfilled or where the Revenue Com-missioners have satisfied the court that the application is substan-tially motivated by a desire to avoid or reduce tax liability.
Subsection (5) requires the court, in assessing whether a proposed
arrangement would be to the benefit of a relevant person, to haveregard to any benefit or detriment, financial or otherwise, that mayaccrue to that person directly or indirectly as a consequence of thearrangement.
Subsection (6) contains provisions restricting the scope of the
section, e.g. ensuring that it does not interfere with the operation ofcy-pres in relation to charitable trusts.
PART 6
POWERS
(Sections 25 to29)
Part 5 deals with powers relating to property (both land and per-
sonal property), especially powers of appointment. Such powers arecommonly used in family settlements and trusts where, instead ofallocating property directly to specified beneficiaries, the settler givesanother person (the ‘‘donee’’ of the power) power to ‘‘appoint’’ (i.e.select) from a group of potential beneficiaries (the ‘‘objects’’ of thepower) who should become actual beneficiaries (the ‘‘appointees’’)and in what shares. For the most part, this Part does not deal withthe other common power to deal with property, the power ofattorney. The law on such powers was modernised by the Powers ofAttorney Act 1996. Nor does it deal specifically with various powersto deal with property held by persons such as trustees (currentlygoverned by the Trustee Act 1893), personal representatives(governed by the Succession Act 1965) and mortgagees (governedby Part 10).
Section 25 makes it clear that, except where stated otherwise (as
insection 26(1) ), Part 6 applies to both existing and future powers.
This is because most of its provisions re-enact existing statutoryprovisions.
Section 26 replaces section 12 of the Law of Property Amendment
Act 1859. It concerns execution of a non-testamentary power, i.e.execution other than by making a will (execution by will is governedby section 79 of the Succession Act 1965). Subsection (1) removesthe complicated provisions in section 12 of the 1859 Act (which,
unlike the usual rule for execution of a deed, required two or morewitnesses) and follows the provision in section 79 of the 1965 Act. Itrequires that a donee exercising a power of appointment by a deedneed in future comply only with the usual requirements for executionof a deed (now set out in section 64 ). Because this involves a change
in the law, it applies only to appointments made after the commence-ment of Part 6. Subsection (2) re-enacts the provisions in section 12
of the 1859 Act which make it clear that subsection (1) does not
affect provisions relating to validity of appointments which may becontained expressly in the instrument creating the power ofappointment.
Section 27 relates to release (giving up or surrender) of any kind
of power by its donee. Subsection (1) re-enacts the substance of
section 52 of the Conveyancing Act 1881. The generally acceptedview is that this right to surrender a power does not apply to a doneewho is a trustee or otherwise subject to a fiduciary duty to exerciseit.Subsection (2) gives statutory recognition to this principle.
Section 28 relates to disclaimer of a power, i.e. where the proposed
donee refuses from the outset to accept the power. It re-enacts thesubstance of section 6 of the Conveyancing Act 1882.
Section 29 re-enacts the substance of the provisions of the Illusory
Appointments Act 1830 and the Powers of Appointment Act 1874.It preserves the discretion of a donee of a power of appointment toappoint a very small share of the property to a particular potentialappointee or even to exclude such an appointee from any share atall.Subsection (2) makes it clear that this is subject to any provision
in the instrument creating the power that a particular potentialappointee is not to be excluded from a specified share.
PART 7
CO-OWNERSHIP
(Sections 30 to32)
Part 7 deals with the law relating to co-ownership of land, i.e.
where the legal title to the land is vested in two or more personsconcurrently. Two main types of such ownership are common now-adays, a joint tenancy and a tenancy in common, with ‘‘tenancy’’ inthis context meaning ownership (so that it can relate to both freeholdand leasehold land). The key feature of a joint tenancy is the so-called right of survivorship whereby on death of a joint tenant thatowner’s interest ceases and the land becomes vested thereafter in thesurviving joint tenants. This process continues until the land becomesvested in the last surviving joint tenant as sole owner and the co-ownership ends. On the other hand, in the case of a tenancy in com-mon, each ‘‘tenant’’ has a distinct (but undivided) share which canbe succeeded to on the tenant’s death (e.g. by persons named in thetenant’s will).
Section 30 relates to a long recognised right of joint tenants, the
right of ‘‘severance’’. This involves conversion of the joint tenancyinto a tenancy in common, with the important consequence that theright of survivorship will no longer operate on the death of each jointtenant. This may deprive some joint tenants of the expectation orhope of succeeding to the entire land. Subsection (1) provides that
‘‘unilateral’’ severance, i.e. by one or more joint tenants without theconsent of the other joint tenants, should no longer be permittedunless a court order under section 31 dispensing with consent has
1920been obtained. Subsection (2) makes it clear that consent sufficient
in future to effect a severance must be given by all the other jointtenants prior to the severance and in writing.
Subsection (3) provides clarification of the law concerning events
which might be taken to effect an ‘‘involuntary’’ severance. It pro-vides that there is no severance where the estate or interest of onejoint tenant has a judgment mortgage registered against it (the caselaw suggests that in this situation severance occurs where the jointtenant’s land is unregistered land, but not if it is registered land).Subsection (4) preserves the jurisdiction of the court to find that,
although the legal title to the land remains in the joint tenancy, allthe joint tenants have agreed or shown by their conduct that it shouldbe severed in equity. In such cases, on the death of a joint tenant,the surviving joint tenants will hold the land on trust for themselvesand the successors of the deceased joint tenant (all as tenants incommon of equitable or beneficial shares).
Section 31 replaces the complicated and uncertain provisions of
the Partition Acts 1868 and 1876. Those Acts enable co-owners, orpersons interested in co-owned land, to apply for a partition order(to divide up the land amongst the co-owners, so that each would besole owner of a part and the co-ownership would end) or, if this wasnot practicable, an order for sale of the land and division of theproceeds of sale. Subsection (1 ) confers a new statutory jurisdiction
on the courts to make a wide range of orders specified in subsection
(2). An application for a court order can be made by any person
having an estate or interest in co-owned land. Subsection (4) makes
it clear that this includes a mortgagee or other secured creditor, ajudgment mortgagee and a trustee holding the land for other persons.Subsection (2) lists a wide variety of orders which the court can
make, including orders for partition and a sale and division of theproceeds of sale. It also includes directing accounting adjustments asbetween the co-owners, which may be appropriate where they haveenjoyed different benefits or incurred different expenses in relationto the land. This might arise because one co-owner has lived in ahouse which is co-owned, while another has lived elsewhere. Subsec-
tion (4)(b) spells out the different kinds of adjustments which might
be appropriate according to the circumstances of a particular case.These provisions for accounts replace those originally enacted insection 23 of the Administration of Justice Act 1707. The court maydispense with consent to severance of a joint tenancy where suchconsent is being unreasonably withheld.
Subsection (3) makes it clear that the court has a wide discretion
as to what order it may make, including not making an order in aparticular case. Subsection (5) saves the courts’ jurisdiction under
other legislation which also applies to co-owners, such as spousesunder the Family Home Protection Act 1976 and the Family LawActs 1995 and 1996 (which provide for orders relating to matrimonialproperty in judicial separation and divorce proceedings). Subsection
(6)clarifies that section 31 is intended to replace the existing equit-
able jurisdiction of the courts to make an order for partition.
Section 32 re-enacts the substance of the Bodies Corporate (Joint
Tenancy) Act 1899. This was enacted to enable corporate bodieslike banks and other financial institutions to hold property in a jointtenancy with others. This is important where such corporations areappointed trustees of property. Subsection (1) provides that in such
cases the corporate body is treated as if it were an individual and so,under subsection (2) , can hold property as a joint tenant with another
corporate body or an individual joint tenant. A corporate body doesnot die like an individual, but it can be dissolved and so subsection(3)provides that dissolution triggers the right of survivorship in the
same way that death does with an individual joint tenant.
PART 8
APPURTENANT RIGHTS
(Sections 33 to50)
Part 8 provides for a substantial overhaul of the law relating to
‘‘appurtenant’’ rights. These are rights which are extremely commonwith respect to land and usually exist as between neighbouring land-owners. They permit one landowner to do something on a neigh-bour’s land or entitle that landowner to prevent the neighbour fromdoing something on that neighbour’s land. The most common categ-ories of such rights are ‘‘easements’’ and ‘‘ profits a `prendre ’’, the law
of which was developed over the centuries largely by the courts. Aneasement is a right like a right of way or right of light over neigh-bouring land. Although examples of an easement are generally wellsettled, the courts have made it clear that the categories are notnecessarily ‘‘closed’’ and new rights with similar characteristics maybe recognised as changes in society require, e.g. a right to park avehicle. A profit a `prendre is the right to go onto someone else’s land
and to take from it something which exists on it naturally, such asthe right to mine or quarry, cut timber or turf, graze animals ongrass, fish and hunt wild game. Such profits are often enjoyed by aneighbouring landowner, and so are appurtenant, but it should benoted that they can also be owned ‘‘in gross’’, i.e. by a person whois not a neighbour and who may own no land other than the profit
exercisable over someone else’s land.
Chapter 1 deals with easements and profits a `prendre .Chapter 2
deals with another type of right which may be owned in respect ofsomeone else’s land, a rentcharge. This is to be distinguished from aleasehold rent, i.e. a rent reserved by a landlord under a tenancy andpayable by the tenant. A rentcharge is a rent charged on land toprovide an income or regular payments to the owner of the rent-charge. Such a charge used to be commonly created in family settle-ments in order to provide an income for members who were givenno other substantial interest in the land (e.g. siblings of the member,usually the eldest son, who was given a life interest in the land).Such family settlements are no longer common. Another commoncategory of rentcharge is statutory ones, usually created in favour ofpublic bodies as a method of repaying funds expended on the land,e.g. on its drainage and improvement.
Chapter 3 provides for a new statutory regime to deal with prob-
lems which frequently arise in relation to party structures, such asparty walls and fences separating neighbouring buildings or lands.This is designed to regulate the rights of the neighbouring owners,especially where a dispute occurs over repairs or works which oneowner wishes to carry out. These provisions, which are to someextent based on provisions which apply to Dublin under the DublinCorporation Act 1890, would replace the long-forgotten provisionsin the Boundaries Act 1721. They also extend to situations wherethere may not be strictly a party structure, but buildings are built soclose to the boundary line with a neighbouring property that work(such as repairs) cannot be carried out effectively without accessfrom the neighbouring property. The provisions regulate neighbourdisputes in such situations by enabling one landowner to obtain acourt ‘‘works’’ order permitting such access on certain conditions.
2122Chapter 4 remedies a longstanding defect in the law. This is the
limited enforceability of freehold covenants affecting land. Suchcovenants are frequently entered into when a landowner sells part ofthe land to someone else. The purchaser will often covenant torestrict the use of the land purchased and to undertake various posi-tive obligations relating to building and repairs. Unlike the case ofleasehold covenants which generally bind successors in title, freeholdcovenants are enforceable against successors in title to a limited
extent only, e.g. the burden of negative (or restrictive) freeholdcovenants only will pass to successors. Chapter 4 changes the law
substantially so as to make the enforceability of freehold covenants,whether positive or negative, accord with that of leaseholdcovenants.
Easements and profits a `prendre
Section 33 contains important definitions relating to the provisions
ofChapter 1 which concern easements and profits a `prendre . Many
of them relate to the law of prescription which governs the acquis-ition of such interests by long user over a substantial period of time.They preserve some of the key features of prescription which haveexisted for centuries, such as the necessity for the user over the requi-site period to be without interruption. Adopting a provision in thePrescription Act 1832 (which was applied to Ireland by the Prescrip-tion (Ireland) Act 1858), such an interruption will be effective toprevent acquisition by prescription only if it lasts for a continuousperiod of at least one year. The user upon which a claim by prescrip-tion is based must be user ‘‘as of right’’, which is now given a statu-tory definition which accords with what the courts have held overthe centuries. The period of long user, which under current law,especially the 1832 Act, varies in length and according to whether aneasement or profit a `prendre is being claimed, is now a single period
of 12 years. This coincides with the period for adverse possessionclaims under the Statute of Limitations 1957. However, in order toprotect State authorities which own tracts of land, including the fore-shore, every part of which it is impracticable to keep under constantsupervision, extended periods of user are require d — a minimum of
30 years and 60 years in the case of claims relating to the foreshore.
Section 34 provides for simplification of the law of prescription. It
abolishes two of the three existing methods of prescription: prescrip-tion at common law (which is based on user dating back to the year1189), and under the now discredited ‘‘fictional’’ judicial doctrine oflost modern grant. In future a prescriptive claim must be based uponthe provisions in section 35 , as supplemented by sections 36 to38.
These replace the complicated provisions of the Prescription Act1832.
Section 35 provides that legal title to an easement or profit a `
prendre will not be obtained by prescription unless and until the
claimant obtains a court order to this effect and it is registered in theRegistry of Deeds (if the claim relates to unregistered land) or LandRegistry (if it relates to registered land). It is envisaged that themethod of registration will be prescribed by general rules under theRegistration of Title Act 1964 and the Registration of Deeds andTitle Act 2006. Subsection (2) maintains a provision in the 1832 Act
which requires that the relevant user period upon which a claim isbased is that immediately before the commencement of the claim-ant’s action. Where a court order has been obtained but has not yetbeen registered, the claimant would have an equitable easement orprofit a `prendre in accordance with the usual position of a party who
simply has to complete registration formalities. Subsection (3) pro-
vides that where the relevant user period was not immediately beforethe commencement of the action to establish the existence of the
easement, the court may nonetheless make an order declaring theexistence of the easement if it is satisfied that it is just and equitablein all the circumstances of the case. This will permit the court to haveregard to factors such as long use of the easement even if that usehas been discontinued prior to commencement of the action.
Section 36 deals with the position where the claim relates to land
subject to a tenancy. It simplifies provisions in the Prescription Actwhich also dealt with land subject to a limited freehold estate (likea life estate). Such a limited estate would be an equitable interestonly under Part 2 and the legal title would be vested in a trustee ortrustees under Part 4. There is, therefore, no need to deal with suchcases in section 36 .Subsection (1) provides that where the claimant
by prescription holds a tenancy only in the land which the easementorprofit a `prendre benefits, the easement or profit attaches to the
land and, when the tenancy ends, it passes with the land to the land-lord. Subsection (2) deals with the converse case where the easement
or profit is exercisable over land which is currently occupied by atenant. The easement or profit ends with the tenancy unless thetenant either acquires a superior interest (in which case it attachesto it) or an extension or renewal of the tenancy (in which case itattaches to that extension or renewal). Subsection (3) makes it clear
that this does not prevent the owner of an easement or profit comingto an end under subsection (2) from claiming against a landlord who
resumes possession of the land when the tenancy ends. Provided therequisite period of user continues, the claimant may in due coursebe able to apply for a court order against the landlord (or a newtenant put into possession by the landlord) under section 35 .
Section 37 updates and replaces section 7 of the Prescription Act
1832. It provides that where the owner of the land against which theuser period has commenced to run is incapable of managing his orher affairs due to mental incapacity, the user period ceases to run.However, this does not apply, firstly, where the court considers thatit is reasonable to have expected some other person to have actedon behalf of the incapacitated owner such as a trustee, committee ofa ward of court or an attorney under an enduring power of attorneycoming within the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 or, secondly, where30 years have elapsed since the commencement of the user period.Unlike earlier legislation, minors are not covered by this incapacityprovision because, under Part 4, a minor cannot hold the legal titleto land. Instead, the title is vested in trustees who will be under aduty to protect the minor’s interests (and liable if they do not doso in a satisfactory manner). This provision does not cover physicalincapacity since the person will be capable of handing their ownaffairs or of enlisting the required assistance.
Section 38 relates to the situation where a claimant by prescription
commenced the user period before Chapter 1 comes into force. It
makes the new provisions applicable as soon as possible while at thesame time takes into account vested rights, bearing in mind that theperiod of user required under Chapter 1 is much shorter than the
periods (ranging from 20 to 60 years) required under the precedinglaw. Paragraph (a) makes it clear that a claimant after the com-
mencement of Chapter 1 can apply to the court under section 35 as
soon as the requisite 12-year user period expires after that com-mencement, however many years of user before that commencementalso occurred. Thus a person who commenced user of a potentialright of way 5 years before the commencement of Chapter 1 could
under section 35 apply 12 years after that commencement, i.e. after
a total of 17 years instead of having to wait the minimum of 20 yearswhich the preceding law would have required. Furthermore, once 12
2324years expires after the commencement of Chapter 1 , all subsequent
claims must be based on the new law. Paragraph (b) deals with the
case where the period of user required under the existing law wasactually or was close to being completed before the commencementof Chapter 1, but the court action to claim the easement or profit isnot made until after that commencement. In such a case the claimantcan rely on the old law provided the action is brought within 3 yearsof that commencement. Once that transitional period has expired,any subsequent claim must rely upon the new provisions inChapter 1 .
Section 39 modifies the law relating to extinguishment of ease-
ments and profits a `prendre . It introduces a new presumption which
applies only to easements and profits acquired by prescription orby implication (such as where the court implies them when land issubdivided without any reference to easements or profits).
The new presumption is that a 12 year continuous period of non-
user will extinguish the easement or profit but this will not apply ifit has been protected by registration in the Registry of Deeds orLand Registry. It is envisaged that the method of registration will beprescribed by general rules under the Registration of Title Act 1964and the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006. Nor does thispresumption apply to easements or profits which have been createdexpressly by the parties. The presumption, which is designed to facili-tate conveyancing by relieving purchasers of the need to makeenquiries or search for possible easements or profits not mentionedin any documents of title, will apply largely to easements and profitsacquired by prescription before the commencement of Chapter 1 or,
under section 38(b), within 3 years of that commencement. Any
acquired by prescription thereafter will have to be registered undersection 35 .
Subsection (2) applies the new presumption even where the period
of non-user commenced before the commencement of Chapter 1 , but
only if at least 3 of the 12 years non-user occur after that commence-ment. This protects the owner of the easement or profit by givingthat owner a period of grace to prevent extinguishment by eitherresuming user (so as to prevent the 12 year period expiring) or pro-tecting the easement or profit by registering it. Subsection (3) pre-
serves the existing law under which the court may declare that aneasement or profit has been extinguished on the basis of evidenceestablishing a clear intention by the owner to abandon it, however itwas acquired.
Section 40 clarifies and simplifies the law relating to acquisition of
easements by implied grant. This usually arises when a landowner(grantor) conveys (grants) part of the land to another person (thegrantee), but no express provision is made in the deed for creationof easements or profits in favour of the grantee (for the benefit ofthe grantee’s land and exercisable over the part of the land retainedby the grantor). Subsection (1) abolishes the complex and uncertain
rule developed by the courts to deal with this situation, known as theRule in Wheeldon v. Burrows , and provides that it shall be replaced
bysubsection (2) .
Subsection (2) only deals with easements arising by implication as
it clearly cannot operate where there is an express provision govern-ing any easement or, indeed, countermanding in general terms theapplication of section 40 to a particular disposition. Under paragraph
(a) the easement must be necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of
the part of the land disposed of. Paragraph (b) provides that the
court must be satisfied that it was reasonable for the parties, orwould have been if they had thought about it, to assume the ease-
ment was included in the disposition and makes it clear that the testis an objective one. Both paragraphs (a) and ( b) must be satisfied.
Subsection (3) makes it clear that section 40 does not affect ease-
ments of necessity, e.g. where after selling part of his land the grantorfinds himself landlocked and needs a right of access through the partsold, easements implied by the court in order to give effect to thepresumed intention of the parties and the principle that a grantormust not derogate from his or her grant, i.e. having conveyed landto a person, the grantor must not deny or prevent that person fromfull enjoyment of it.
Rentcharges
Section 41 prohibits the future creation of rentcharges, subject to
the exceptions listed in subsection (2). These cover implementation
of any contract to create a rentcharge entered into before the com-mencement of Chapter 2 and creation of rentcharges under a court
order or statutory provision.
Section 42 simplifies the statutory provisions governing enforce-
ment of rentcharges contained in section 44 of the Conveyancing Act1881. In future such rentcharges will be enforceable as a simple con-tract debt, but this is subject to any other statutory provision (notincluding section 44 of the 1881 Act which is repealed by the Act).
Party structures
Section 43 provides various definitions for the provisions relating
to party structures contained in Chapter 3 . In particular, it contains
a comprehensive definition of a ‘‘party structure’’ and of the ‘‘works’’which may be the subject of a ‘‘works order’’. For the purposes ofthese provisions the court is the District Court.
Section 44 confers a new statutory right on a landowner to carry
out works to a party structure subject to the terms and conditionsset out in the section. Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances where
this right arises, e.g. in order to comply with a statutory provision,notice or order or to preserve the party structure or the building orland of which it forms part. It also covers the case where the worksto the party structure relate to other works which will not causesubstantial damage or inconvenience to the adjoining owner or, ifthey cause this, it is nevertheless reasonable to carry the works out.
Subsection (2) requires the building owner to make good any dam-
age caused to the adjoining owner or to reimburse the reasonablecosts and expenses of making good any damage, and to pay pro-fessional costs and compensation for any inconvenience incurred.Subsection (3) entitles the building owner to claim a contribution to
or make deductions from such amounts so as to take account of theproportionate use or enjoyment of the party structures which theadjoining owner makes or is likely to make.
Subsection (4) provides that the adjoining owner may apply to the
court for an order requiring that any damage be made good if thebuilding owner fails to do so within a reasonable time or, alterna-tively, if the building owner fails to reimburse the costs and expensesof doing so within a reasonable period, the adjoining owner mayrecover the costs and expenses as a simple contract debt. If theadjoining owner fails to meet a claim to a contribution undersubsection (3) , the building owner may recover the contribution as a
simple contract debt.
2526Section 45 enables a building owner who is in dispute over works
to a party structure to apply for a District Court order (‘‘worksorder’’) authorising the works. Subsection (2) requires the court, in
deciding whether to make a works order and, if one is to be made,what its terms and conditions should be, to have regard to the pro-visions of section 44. It also gives the court a discretion to take into
account any other circumstances which it considers relevant.
Section 46 gives the court a wide discretion as to the terms and
conditions which may be attached to a works order. Without preju-dice to the generality of subsection (1) ,subsection (2) makes it clear
that such terms and conditions may authorise entry on the adjoiningowner’s land and require the building owner to give security or anindemnity to the adjoining owner. Subsection (3) makes it clear that
a works order must not authorise permanent interference with orloss of any easement of light or other easement (such as a right ofsupport) or any other right relating to a party structure.
Section 47 gives the District Court jurisdiction to discharge or
modify a works order, on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit.
Freehold covenants
Section 48 provides definitions for the provisions relating to free-
hold covenants contained in Chapter 4.
Section 49 provides new statutory provisions governing
enforceability of freehold covenants against successors in title. Sub-
section (1) makes it clear that the new provisions replace the old law,
including the limited rule in Tulk v. Moxhay (whereby the burden of
a negative — as opposed to a positive — covenant only bindssuccessors). Subsection (2) contains the new law which makes free-
hold covenants bind successors fully, in the sense that the benefitwill run with the land intended to be benefited and the burden willrun with the land subject to the covenant. Generally the benefit andburden will attach to the owner for the time being of the lands inquestion so long as they are such owners. However, a person who hasceased to be the owner of the benefited land may enforce breaches ofcovenant which occurred before he or she ceased to be the owner.Similarly, a person may be liable for breaches which occurred whilethe owner of the land was subject to the covenant, but which arepursued after that person ceased to be owner of that land.
Subsection (3) preserves the principles relating to a ‘‘scheme of
development’’ evolved by the courts (sometimes known as the ruleinElliston v. Reacher ). In such a development (such as a housing
estate or shopping centre developed by a common vendor orlandlord) the benefit of a covenant may be enforced by a person whois not strictly a successor in title to the person who originally tookthe benefit of the covenant, but rather by another purchaser or lesseeowning a house or commercial unit in the same development.
Subsection (4) deals with obligations relating to subdivided land.
It provides for the appropriate apportionment of such obligationsbetween the subdivided parts of the land and for the enforceabilityof the obligations. Subsection (5) provides that disputes regarding
the application of subsection (4) to a particular case may be referred
to the court for determination.
Subsection (6) clarifies the operation of the new provisions. Para-
graph (a) provides that section 49 does not affect the enforceability
of a covenant under the doctrine of privity of contract. It also doesnot affect covenants for title, the enforceability of which is governedbysection 80 . The application of the Statute of Limitations 1957 to
a freehold covenant is not affected. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that
it is possible to contract out of the new provisions, by making it clearthat a particular covenant is personal to a party or the parties to itand does not pass to successors in title.
Section 50 contains new provisions entitling a person subject to a
freehold covenant, whether created before or after the commence-ment of Chapter 4, to apply for a court order discharging it in wholeor in part or modifying it on the ground that it now constitutes anunreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the landsubject to it. Freehold covenants may last for ever and over timemay become obsolete or no longer serve a useful purpose, but thereis no mechanism under current law for discharging or modifyingthem except by agreement of the parties. Obtaining such agreementmay be difficult and expensive and the person entitled to the benefitmay refuse to negotiate even though the purpose behind thecovenant has long gone.
Subsection (2) sets out various matters to which the court must
have regard, as appropriate, in determining whether to make anorder and, if one is made, what its terms and conditions should be.These include such matters as changes in the character of the landsaffected by the covenant, what benefit, if any, it still secures, whethercontinued compliance has become unduly onerous compared withthat benefit and any other matter which the court considers relevant.Subsection (3) makes it clear that the court may include as part of
its order a requirement that compensation is paid to cover a quantifi-able loss resulting from the order.
Subsection (4) requires a court order under subsection (1) to be
registered in the Registry of Deeds (if the order relates to unregis-tered land) or Land Registry (if it relates to registered land). It isenvisaged that the method of registration will be prescribed by gen-eral rules under the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the Regis-tration of Deeds and Title Act 2006.
PART 9
CONTRACTS AND CONVEYANCES
(Sections 51 to88)
This Part deals with contracts and conveyances relating to land
and replaces the provisions of the Conveyancing Acts 1881 to 1911and other pre-1922 statutes. It aims at both reforming the law andsimplifying those provisions. In so doing it prepares the ground foreConveyancing, but also deals with the interim period before such afully electronic and paperless system of conveyancing becomes oper-ative. Until that happens, written documents and deeds in the tradit-ional form will continue to be used. Chapter 1 deals with contracts
relating to land, such as contracts for sale. Chapter 2 deals with title
matters, in particular deduction of title by a vendor and investigationof title by a purchaser. Chapter 3 deals with deeds and their oper-
ation, including the formalities for proper execution of deeds andthe effect of particular provisions in deeds. Chapter 4 deals with the
contents of deeds, in particular statutory provisions to be implied inthem. Chapter 5 contains some general provisions concerning con-
veyancing.
2728Contracts
Section 51 re-enacts the substance of section 2 of the Statute of
Frauds 1695 which requires written evidence of a contract relating toland to be produced in court if enforcement of the contract is sought.Subsection (2) makes it clear that equitable doctrines, such as part
performance or estoppel, will continue to be available as an alterna-tive method of enforcement. Subsection (3) clarifies a matter upon
which there has been some doubt. It provides that payment of adeposit, and reference to such in the written evidence of the contract,is not necessary to an enforceable contract, unless there is an expressagreement otherwise (as is the case where the Law Society’s GeneralConditions of Sale are used).
Section 52 deals with a controversial aspect of the majority
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Tempany v. Hynes
[1976] IR 101. Subsection (1) restores the previously accepted view
that the entire beneficial interest in land passes to the purchaserupon the entering into of the contract for sale regardless of howmuch of the purchase price is paid at that time (usually only a 10%deposit is paid then). Subsection (2) clarifies the effect of subsection
(1)and again reflects the generally accepted view as to the position
of the parties under a contract for sale of land. In particular it con-firms the vendor’s obligation to maintain the land so long as pos-session is retained pending completion and to carry the risk of lossor damage under a contractual provision such as the Law Society’sGeneral Conditions of Sale. It also confirms the vendor’s right torescind where the purchaser fails to complete or otherwise breachesthe contract. Finally, it makes it clear that subsection (1) can be
excluded by an express provision in the contract.
Section 53 abolishes the outmoded rule in Bain v. Fothergill (1874)
which restricted the damages recoverable by a purchaser for a breachof contract by a vendor who fails to make good title to the landcontracted to be sold. This rule has been criticised by the Irish courts.Subsection (2) makes it clear that this abolition applies only to future
contracts for sale.
Section 54 clarifies a point upon which there has been much uncer-
tainty. It confirms that where a court refuses to order specific per-formance of a contract against a purchaser, it has an unfettereddiscretion to order a refund of the whole or any part of any depositpaid by the purchaser. Previous case law had suggested that thiscould only be done where there was clear evidence of fraud or otherclear default by the vendor.
Section 55 re-enacts the substance of section 9 of the Vendor and
Purchaser Act 1874. Subsection (1) provides a summary jurisdiction
for resolving questions which may arise concerning a contract for thesale or other disposition of land. Subsection (2) confirms the court’s
wide discretion as the orders which can be made, including orders asto costs. Subsection (3) retains the limitation on the scope of the
summary jurisdiction, that it cannot be used to determine questionsaffecting the existence or validity of the contract.
Title
Section 56 deals with the title a vendor is required to deduce under
an ‘‘open’’ contract for sale (i.e. where there is no express provisionon the matter in the contract). Subsection (1) reduces the period of
title from the 40 years prescribed by section 1 of the Vendor andPurchaser Act 1874 to 15 years. Subsection (2) confirms the long-
standing rule that where the title commences with a fee farm grantor lease, that grant or lease must be produced. Although section 12of the Act prohibits the creation of fee farm grants, existing ones will
remain a feature of some titles for a limited period. Subsection (3)
confirms that the statutory period applies only to an ‘‘open’’ contract.
Section 57 replaces, with some modification, the provisions relating
to deduction of titles comprising a tenancy in the Vendor and Pur-chaser Act 1874 and Conveyancing Acts 1881 and 1882. Subsection
(1)re-enacts the rule that in such cases the intended grantee or
assignee cannot call for the title to the freehold or a superior tenancy.Subsection (2) qualifies subsection (1) and modifies the provisions in
the 1874 and 1881 Acts. Where a tenancy or subtenancy exceeding 5years is being granted, the intended grantee may call for more ofthe grantor’s title, as recommended in the Law Society’s guidelines.However, subsection (5) makes it clear that this is subject to the
terms of the contract for the grant. Subsection (3) re-enacts the pro-
vision in section 4 of the Conveyancing Act 1882 excluding a contractfor a tenancy as a title document once the contract has been com-pleted by a grant of the tenancy itself. Subsection (4) abolishes the
rule known as the Rule in Patman v. Harland by providing that a
purchaser is not affected by notice of any matter or thing which existsin the title which subsection (1) debars the purchaser from seeing.
Section 58 re-enacts the substance of other provisions relating to
title in the 1874 and 1881 Acts. Subsection (1) prohibits a purchaser
from calling for ‘‘pre-root’’ title, i.e. title earlier than that referred toinsection 56 or the contract for sale, and requires him or her to
assume that recitals in documents of title produced relating to suchprior title are correct and recited instruments were properlyexecuted. Subsection (2) re-enacts exceptions to subsection (1) cover-
ing situations where the validity or effectiveness of a produceddocument of title depends on some pre-root instrument, e.g. a powerof attorney. That pre-root instrument should also be produced. Sub-
section (3) re-enacts the requirement that the purchaser should bear
the expenses of production of documents relating to the title.
Subsection (4) re-enacts provisions relating to a sale of land in lots,
whereby a purchaser of two or more lots must meet the expense ofproduction of more than one copy of any document relating to thecommon title of the whole land. Subsection (5) re-enacts the pro-
vision that a purchaser cannot refuse to complete where a vendorcannot furnish an acknowledgment of the right to production anddelivery of documents of title, if a right to such production arises oncompletion of the contract. Subsection (6) re-enacts the requirement
that the purchaser must meet the expense of acknowledgments andundertakings for safe custody of documents which the vendor retains(because part only of the vendor’s land is being sold). Further pro-visions for such acknowledgments and undertakings are contained insection 84 .
Subsection (7) re-enacts provisions entitling the vendor to retain
documents of title in certain situations, such as a sale of part only ofhis or her land. Subsection (8) re-enacts the rule that these provisions
are subject to the terms of the contract for sale. Subsection (9) re-
enacts the rule that a purchaser is not bound by stipulations in thecontract similar to the statutory ones if the court would not enforcethe contract against the purchaser. Subsection (10) provides defini-
tions for certain expressions used throughout section 58 .
Section 59 re-enacts provisions in section 2 of the 1874 Act
designed to protect purchasers in conveyancing transactions. Subsec-
tion (1) provides for the presumption that recitals, statements and
descriptions in instruments, statutory provisions or statutory declar-ations at least 15 years old are accurate. Subsection (2) re-enacts the
2930presumption that, where the land sold is held under a tenancy, the
tenancy was duly granted and, where the receipt for the last paymentof rent is produced, that the covenants and provisions of the tenancyhave been performed and observed up to completion of the pur-chase. Subsection (3) contains equivalent presumptions where the
land sold is held under a subtenancy.
Section 60 re-enacts provisions in the Law of Property Amend-
ment Acts 1859 and 1860. Subsection (1) makes it a criminal offence
for a vendor, or the vendor’s solicitor or other agent, to conceal orfalsify documents of title or matters relating to the title. Subsection
(2)gives the purchaser or any person deriving title from the pur-
chaser a right of action for damages for any loss sustained from suchoffences. Subsection (3) provides for inclusion in such an award of
damages of compensation for improvements made by the purchaserto the land before it is recovered by the rightful owner. Subsection
(4)contains a saving for the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Theft
and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.
Section 61 re-enacts provisions in section 11 of the Conveyancing
Act 1911 which entitle a purchaser of part of land held under a com-mon title to require an endorsement or annexation of a notice on oneof the documents of title retained by the vendor showing restrictivecovenants or other rights (such as easements) being conferred on thepurchaser over the vendor’s retained land. Subsection (1) makes it
clear that this right cannot be contracted out of. Subsection (2) makes
it clear that subsection (1) confers a right to have a notice endorsed
or annexed, not an obligation to require one, so that omitting to
exercise the right does not prejudice the purchaser’s title. Subsection
(3)excludes application of the section to registered land because
such matters would in such a case be dealt with by entries on therelevant folio.
Deeds
Section 62 substantially modifies the law relating to conveyances
of land. Subsection (1) substitutes the modern deed as the only
method of conveying legal title subject to the exceptions set out insection 63 .Subsection (4) abolishes the various methods developed
under the feudal system and which were preserved by the RealProperty Act 1845. Subsection (2) makes it clear that a deed is fully
effective without the need for a ‘‘conveyance to uses’’ or the granteehaving to enter into physical possession of the land conveyed. TheAct repeals the Statute of Uses 1634 and removes the complicatedlaw which arose from it. Subsection (3) reinforces this by removing
the main reason why a conveyance to uses has continued to beadopted here, i.e. that otherwise a resulting use for the grantormight arise.
Section 63 lists well-established exceptions to the rule that a deed
must be used in order to create or convey a legal estate or interest inland. These include assents by personal representatives (which undersection 52 of the Succession Act 1965 need be in writing only) andtransfers taking effect by operation at law, such as a surrender of atenancy by the tenant giving up the property with the consent ofthe landlord.
Section 64 modifies substantially the formalities for proper
execution of deeds. Subsection (1) abolishes the need for a seal in
the case of execution by an individual. A seal will remain necessaryfor corporations. It also abolishes the rule that authority given toanother person to deliver a deed must itself be given by deed. Thishas already been done for powers of attorney by section 15 of the
Powers of Attorney Act 1996.
Subsection (2) sets out the new requirements for deeds following
abolition of the need for sealing by individuals. Paragraph (a) pro-
vides for identification of a document as a deed by giving it an appro-priate heading or otherwise making it clear on its face that it isintended to be a deed or by expressing it to be executed or signedas a deed. Paragraph (b) then sets out the different methods of
execution depending upon the status of the person or body execut-ing. Subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) preserve the existing law relating to
corporations. Subparagraph (iv) resolves doubts as to the position
regarding foreign corporations executing instruments (many do nothave provision for sealing), by providing that the instrument is adeed if executed in accordance with the legal requirements governingexecution in the jurisdiction where the body in question is incorpor-ated. Paragraph (c) retains the requirement of delivery of a deed.
Subsection (3) provides that a deed executed under this section has
effect as if it were a document executed under seal. This provision isnecessary to deal with instruments which would otherwise beenforceable, e.g., contracts where there is no consideration involved.Subsection (4) re-enacts the provision in section 5 of the Real Prop-
erty Act 1845 removing the need to ‘‘indent’’ (give it an indentededge) or to call it an indenture.
Section 65 clarifies the law relating to execution of deeds by cor-
porations. Subsection (1) abolishes the rule that the mere affixing of
the corporate seal constitutes full delivery and subsection (2) makes
it clear now that a corporation can deliver a deed ‘‘in escrow’’(subject to a condition which must be satisfied before it becomeseffective) just like an individual.
Section 66 consolidates provisions in section 21 of the Law of Prop-
erty Amendment Act 1859 and section 50 of the Conveyancing Act1881. Subsection (1) re-enacts the rule that a person can convey prop-
erty (both land and personal property) jointly to himself or herselfand another person. Under section 83 , covenants in such a convey-
ance are enforceable as if entered into with that other person alone.Subsection (2) modifies existing law by enabling a person generally
to convey property to himself or herself in a different capacity.Section 52 of the Succession Act 1965 permits a personal representa-tive to execute an assent in his or her own favour. Now a trustee canconvey property to himself or herself as a beneficiary of the trust ora donee can exercise a general power of appointment in his or herown favour. Paragraph (a) excepts from this the leasing of property
because a lease to oneself would merge with the lessor’s reversionand create unenforceable covenants. Subsection (4) contains the rule
that a covenant entered into with oneself is unenforceable. Para-
graph (b) confirms the rule that two or more persons can convey
property to a lesser number of themselves. Subsection (3) makes it
clear that the relaxation of the rules concerning conveyances to one-self does not validate any conveyance otherwise voidable for breachof trust or other fiduciary obligation.
Section 67 abolishes the need for ‘‘words of limitation’’ (special
words denoting the freehold estate being conveyed) in conveyancesof unregistered land. This was done for transfers of registered landby section 123 of the Registration of Title Act 1964. Subsection (1)
provides that a conveyance with or without words of limitation willconvey whatever estate or interest the grantor has unless a contraryintention is apparent in the conveyance. Subsection (2) applies the
same rule to conveyances by a corporation sole, such as a bishop or
3132Government Minister (words of limitation are not needed in convey-
ances by other corporations).
Subsection (3) abolishes an arcane rule derived from the feudal
system known as the Rule in Shelley’s Case , by providing that a con-
veyance such as ‘‘to A for life, remainder to A’s heirs’’ will takeeffect as stated, i.e. givin g A a life estate only (operating as a trust
of land under Part 4 of the Act) and his or her heirs a fee simple inremainder. The meaning of ‘‘heirs’’ is given by section 15(3) of theSuccession Act 1965. Subsection (4) applies these provisions to cure
defects in conveyances executed before the commencement of thisChapter of Part 8, but without prejudice to existing interests acquiredby application of the previous law.
Section 68 makes provision for interests acquired under the pre-
vious law as a result of failure to use words of limitation in a convey-ance or the application of the Rule in Shelley’s Case Subsection (1)
requires any person claiming such an existing interest to claim itwithin 12 years by obtaining a court order and registering this undersubsection (3) . It is envisaged that the method of registration under
subsection (3) will be prescribed by general rules under the Regis-
tration of Title Act 1964 and the Registration of Deeds and Title Act2006. Subsection (2) gives the court a wide discretion as to how to
deal with such claims. Under paragraph (b) it may refuse to make
an order in favour of the claimant if satisfied that no substantialinjustice will be done to any party and under paragraph (c) it may
order compensation to be paid to the claimant instead of granting adeclaration of entitlement to the interest claimed.
Section 69 simplifies the law relating to reservation of rights by a
grantor in a conveyance. It removes complications involving the Stat-ute of Uses 1634, which is repealed, and replaces provisions insection 62 of the Conveyancing Act 1881 relating to reservation ofeasements. Subsection (1) removes the need for the grantee to
execute the conveyance or a ‘‘re-grant’’ in order to render a reser-vation in favour of the grantor effective, e.g. a right of way reservedby the grantor over the land conveyed to the grantee. Subsection (2)
confirms the rule that a conveyance subject to an estate or interestnot in existence involves a reservation, as opposed to an ‘‘exception’’which involves the grantor retaining an existing interest, e.g. mineralsin the land. Subsection (3) reinforces the new rule in subsection (1)
that a reservation does not need execution of a regrant by thegrantee. This ensures that in future any ambiguities in the wordingof a reservation will be construed against the grantor in accordancewith the general rule of construction (that a deed is construed againstthe grantor). Subsection (4) makes it clear that the new rules in
section 69 apply to future reservations only.
Section 70 replaces and clarifies section 5 of the Real Property Act
1845, which enables a person not a party to a deed, but named in itas entitled to an estate or interest, or the benefit of a covenant orright, to enforce the deed. Subsection (1) now makes it clear that this
provision operates only where the deed expressly confers the interestor benefit on that person and is confined to deeds relating to land.Subsection (2) makes it clear that the provision does not otherwise
affect the doctrine of privity of contract, under which generally onlythe parties to a contract can enforce it.
Section 71 replaces and clarifies the operation of section 6 of the
Conveyancing Act 1881, which specifies what features and rights areincluded in a conveyance of land. Subsections (1) and (2)largely
reproduce the substance of section 6(1) and (2) of the 1881 Act(section 6(3) related to the feudal concept of manors and is notreproduced). Subsection (3) provides the clarification. Paragraph (a)
makes it clear that the section does not create any new rights orconvert any quasi-right into a full one or extend the scope of anexisting right or convert one into a greater one. This reflects theviews of the Supreme Court in the case of William Bennett Construc-
tion Ltd v. Greene [2004] ILRM 96. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that
the section does not give the grantee any better title or greaterinterest than the grantor had. Paragraph (c) , however, makes it clear
that the section has effect subject to the terms of the conveyance.
Section 72 re-enacts the substance of section 53 of the Conveyanc-
ing Act 1881, but extends the provisions governing supplementalinstruments to all instruments and not just deeds. Subsection (2) con-
firms that the provisions do not affect the position as regards titlewhich a purchaser can require the vendor to produce.
Section 73 re-enacts the substance of sections 10 and 11 of the Law
of Property Amendment Act 1859. It deals with partial releases of arentcharge or judgment charged on land and reverses the commonlaw rule that a partial release released the entire land charged. Para-
graph (b) ofsubsection (2) clarifies the law by making it clear that,
unless the parties agree otherwise, the whole rentcharge or judgmentcan be enforced against the part of the land not released from it.
Section 74 replaces the complicated and uncertain provisions gov-
erning fraudulent dispositions in sections 1 to 5, 10, 11 and 14 of theConveyancing Act 1634, as amended by the Voluntary ConveyancesAct 1893. Subsection (1) recasts sections 1 to 5, subsection (2) recasts
the provisions of the 1893 Act and subsection (3) recasts the pro-visions of sections 10 and 11. Paragraph (a) ofsubsection (4) recasts
the provisions of section 14 of the 1634 Act. Paragraph (b) contains
a saving for the provisions of other laws relating to bankruptcy orcorporate insolvency, such as sections 57 to 59 of the BankruptcyAct 1988.
Contents of deeds
Section 75 introduces a new aid to construction of private
documents by making available the general rules of construction anddefinitions of key words in statutes provided by the InterpretationAct 2005. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that where the same word is
defined in both the 2005 Act and this Act, the definition which ismost appropriate should be relied upon. For example, the definitionof ‘‘land’’ in section 3 of this Act is more extensive.
Section 76 re-enacts the substance of section 63 of the Conveyanc-
ing Act 1881 and provides that, subject to the terms of the convey-ance, it passes everything the grantor had power to convey.
Section 77 re-enacts, with some modifications, the provisions in
sections 54 to 56 of the Conveyancing Act 1881 dealing with receiptsin deeds. Subsection (1) re-enacts section 54. Subsection (2) re-enacts
section 55, but renders the receipt conclusive rather than merely suf-ficient evidence. Subsection (3) re-enacts section 56 with a similar
modification. Subsection (4) clarifies subsection (3) by making it clear
that it extends to employees and agents of solicitors.
Section 78 re-enacts the substance of section 4 of the Real Property
Act 1845 and ensures that conveyances do not have an unintendedeffect, such as implying conditions or covenants.
Sections 79 to81recast the provisions relating to statutory coven-
ants for title contained in section 7 of the Conveyancing Act 1881.
3334Section 79 clarifies the scope of sections 80 and 81. In particular it
makes it clear that they do not apply to a conveyance comprising theinitial grant of a tenancy or subtenancy (as opposed to subsequentassignments of the tenancy). Covenants implied on such a grant aregoverned by section 41 of Deasy’s Act 1860.
Section 80 makes provision for implied covenants relating to title
according to different classes of conveyance. The actual covenantsthemselves are set out in Schedule 3. Section 80 removes the flaw in
section 7 of the 1881 Act by requiring only that a person be‘‘expressed’’ to convey in a particular capacity (e.g. as beneficialowner), whether or not he or she actually has it. This restores theessential purpose and value of the implied covenants. Subsection (4)
makes it clear that no covenant is implied unless a person isexpressed to convey in one of the capacities specified in the section,but there is a saving for the exception provided by section 52(6) ofthe Succession Act 1965 (covenants implied in an assent whether ornot a personal representative is expressed to convey as such).
Section 81 provides for additional covenants to be implied in con-
veyances of land comprised in a lease, on the part of both an assignorand assignee. It includes provisions relating to assignments of part ofthe land, where adjustments, including apportionment, of the rentmay be made.
Section 82 re-enacts the substance of section 60 of the Conveyanc-
ing Act 1881 and deals with enforceability of covenants entered intoby two or more persons.
Section 83 resolves a problem which exists at common law owing
to the rule that a person may not contract with himself or herself. Itprovides that a covenant entered into by a person with himself orherself and another person is enforceable by that other person. Thisis the equivalent for covenants of the provisions for conveyances insection 66 .
Section 84 recasts the provisions in section 9 of the Conveyancing
Act 1881 which apply where a person conveys part only of land andso retains the documents of title relating to the entire land, i.e.including the part conveyed. It provides protection for the purchaserof the part conveyed in the form of a statutory acknowledgment bythe vendor of the purchaser’s right to production of the retaineddocuments (which may be needed in later transactions concerningthe purchaser’s land) and an undertaking to keep them safe.
Section 85 applies the provisions relating to service of notices
under the Act contained in section 4 to service of notices required
by private instruments, subject to the terms of any particularinstrument.
General
Section 86 re-enacts section 3 of the Conveyancing Act 1882, which
deals with the doctrine of constructive notice. This doctrine governsthe duty of a purchaser in investigating title, but this is subject to themodifications introduced by section 21 of the Act.
Section 87 re-enacts section 70 of the Conveyancing Act 1881 and
protects the efficacy of court orders.
Section 88 makes provision for making regulations relating to con-
tracts and conveyances to facilitate electronic conveyancing or pro-vide further protection for vendors and purchasers of land.PART 10
MORTGAGES
(Sections 89 to114)
Part 10 introduces substantial simplification and modernisation of
the law of mortgages. In particular, it assimilates the law relating tounregistered land with registered land, by making a charge the solemethod of creating a legal mortgage. Mortgages by conveyance orassignment of the borrower’s estate or interest in the land or bydemise in the case of leasehold land are abolished. This does notaffect the security interests of mortgagees. The Act also introducesprovisions to ensure that mortgagee’s remedies to enforce securityare exercised only when appropriate. The application of certain pro-visions of Part 10 is modified in relation to housing loan mortgages.
‘‘Housing loan’’ is defined in section 3 to have the meaning given to
it by the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended.
Creation of mortgages
Section 89 introduces the charge as the only method of mortgaging
unregistered land. Subsection (2) provides that any attempt in future
to create a mortgage of unregistered land by any other method shallnot create a legal mortgage. This greatly simplifies the law by requir-ing a charge by deed for all legal mortgages. Subsection (3) makes
an exception to this rule for transactions under a statutory provision.
Subsection (4) makes future powers to mortgage land operate as a
power to charge the land. Subsection (5) confirms that the provisions
of Part 10 dealing with mortgages otherwise apply to both registeredand unregistered land. Subsection (6) provides a saving for equitable
mortgages which may be created informally. Subsection (7) prohibits
the creation of a ‘‘Welsh mortgage’’ — defined in subsection (8) —
because such a mortgage is inconsistent with a fundamental principlereflected in Part 10, i.e. that a mortgagee should be entitled to exer-cise remedies only where this is necessary to protect or enforce themortgagee’s security.
Section 90 confirms that the new form of mortgage by way of a
charge will confer on a mortgagee the usual security rights and rem-edies which the traditional mortgage by conveyance or assignmentdoes. This is, however, subject to modifications introduced by otherprovisions in Part 10. Subsection (2) makes it clear that a mortgagee
with a charge only still has the right to take possession of thedocuments of title until the mortgage is paid off. Subsection (3)
makes a mortgagee who exercises this right responsible for the safecustody of the documents.
Powers and rights of mortgagor
Section 91 re-enacts the substance of section 16 of the Conveyanc-
ing Act 1881, which entitles the mortgagor to inspect and take copiesof documents of title in the possession of the mortgagee.
Section 92 alters the provisions in section 17 of the Conveyancing
Act 1881 by abolishing the mortgagee’s right to consolidate housingloan mortgages, i.e. the right to insist that the mortgagor pays off allmortgages held with the same mortgagee or none at all. Subsection
(1)confirms that a mortgagor can redeem any housing loan mortgage
without having to redeem any other mortgage, whether it relates tothe same or other property mortgaged to the same mortgagee.
3536Section 93 re-enacts the substance of section 15 of the Conveyanc-
ing Act 1881, as amended by section 12 of the Conveyancing Act1882, which entitled a mortgagor to require a transfer of the mort-gage instead of redeeming it. Subsection (3)(a) excludes the case
where the mortgagee is in possession of the land because such amortgagee is liable to account strictly to the mortgagor and wouldremain so even after a transfer.
Section 94 puts in statutory form a jurisdiction which has probably
long existed under the courts’ inherent equitable jurisdiction. Itentitles a mortgagor to seek an order for sale of the land wheneveran action is brought by him or her in relation to the land, such as forredemption. The mortgagor may wish to obtain a sale in order toreduce mounting debt, but the court is given a wide discretion undersubsection (2) as to whether to make an order and the terms of any
order made. Subsection (3) sets out a variety of orders which the
court may make. Subsection (4) provides that except in the case of a
housing loan mortgage, section 94 will take effect subject to the
mortgage.
Section 95 re-enacts the substance of section 61 of the Conveyanc-
ing Act 1881, which deals with mortgages by two or more mortgagorsand their discharge.
Obligations, powers and rights of mortgagees
Section 96 lays down general principles which will in future govern
exercise of a mortgagee’s statutory powers and rights. Paragraph (a)
ofsubsection (1) preserves the rule under the Conveyancing Act 1881
that these powers and rights apply to all mortgages created by deed.Paragraph (b) alters the law by providing that remedies, such as the
power to sell or appoint a receiver, vest as soon as the mortgageis created (instead of arising initially on creation but not becomingexercisable until a default occurs). This is subject to the provisionsin section 62 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 which govern theeffect of a charge on registered land. That section is amended bySchedule 1 of this Act.
However, paragraph (c) makes it clear that notwithstanding this,
in future no remedy can be exercised unless it is for the purposeof protecting the mortgaged property or realising the mortgagee’ssecurity. Other provisions (in particular sections 97 to111) impose
further restrictions on exercise of particular remedies. Subsection (2)
abolishes the mortgagee’s right of foreclosure (this remedy has notbeen granted by an Irish court since the 19th century).
Subsection (3) makes it clear that the provisions regarding the
exercise of a mortgagee’s statutory powers and rights cannot beexcluded or varied in the case of a housing loan mortgage. The par-ties may exclude or vary the statutory provisions in relation to othermortgages except where the provisions specify otherwise.
Section 97 governs the obtaining by a mortgagee of a court order
for possession of the mortgaged property. Subsection (1) makes it
clear that in future such an order must be sought if the mortgageewants to take possession, unless the mortgagor consents in writing tosuch taking within 7 days prior to the taking of possession. Undersection 96(1)(c) the purpose of seeking an order must be for protect-
ing the property or realising the mortgagee’s security. Section 98
deals with emergency applications where the mortgaged property hasbeen abandoned by the mortgagor. Subsection (2) confers a wide
discretion on the court as to whether to make a possession order andthe terms and conditions of any order made, taking account of the
circumstances of the particular case.
Section 98 entitles a mortgagee to seek an emergency order for
possession in order to protect mortgaged property abandoned by themortgagor, either from the District Court or any court already seisedof any applications or proceedings relating to the mortgaged prop-erty. Again the court is given discretion in dealing with applicationsfor such an order. Subsection (4) reverses the usual rule which applies
where a mortgagee takes possession — liability to account strictly tothe mortgagor is not appropriate in cases coming within section 98.
Section 99 regulates the position of a mortgagee in possession of
the mortgaged property. Subject to the terms of any order madeunder sections 97 or98,subsection (1) requires the mortgagee, or any
receiver appointed by the mortgagee, to proceed within a reasonabletime to a sale or, if this is not appropriate, to lease the property anduse the rent to reduce the mortgage debt. Subsection (2) removes an
anomaly in the current law, whereby, notwithstanding that a mort-gagee in possession is liable to account strictly to the mortgagor, itspossession is regarded as ‘‘adverse’’ to the mortgagor and so themortgagor’s right to redeem may become barred under the Statuteof Limitations 1957.
Section 100 provides for the mortgagee’s statutory power of sale,
which was previously governed by various provisions in the Convey-
ancing Acts 1881 and 1911. Subsection (1) provides for the conditions
which must exist before the power of sale arises and requires 28 daysnotice to be served on the mortgagor warning of the possibility ofsuch sale. Subsection (2) makes it clear that the power of sale will in
future be subject to obtaining a court order, unless the mortgagorconsents in writing to the exercise of the power of sale within 7 daysprior to such exercise. Subsection (3) provides that after the expir-
ation of the 28 day notice period, the mortgagee may apply to courtfor an order authorising exercise of the power of sale. The court hasa wide discretion as to whether to make such an order and the termsand conditions of any order made. Subsection (4) provides that an
application under section 100 may be made together with an appli-
cation for possession under section 97 .
Section 101 deals with applications under sections 97 and 100.Sub-
section (1) gives the court discretion to adjourn proceedings, or to
attach conditions to any order it may make, where it appears thatthe mortgagor is likely within a reasonable period to be able to paythe arrears or remedy any other breach of obligation under the mort-gage. Subsection (2) gives the courts discretion to specify terms and
conditions regarding payment of arrears by the mortgagor or theremedying of any breach of obligation. Subsection (3) empowers the
court to revoke or vary such terms and conditions.
Subsection (5) makes it obligatory for lending institutions to com-
mence proceedings for orders for possession or sale in the case ofhousing loan mortgages in the Circuit Court rather than the HighCourt. Under subsection (4) , proceedings for such orders other than
those relating to housing loan mortgages may continue to be takenin the High Court. Subsection (6) provides that the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court to hear and determine applications concerningproperty subject to a housing loan mortgage shall be exercised bythe judge of the circuit where the property or any part of it is situ-ated. Subsection (7) saves the jurisdiction of the court under sections
7 and 8 of the Family Home Protection Act 1976.
3738Section 102 re-enacts the substance of the supplementary pro-
visions relating to the power of sale provided for in the Conveyanc-ing Acts 1881 and 1911.
Section 103 extends to all mortgagees the mortgagee’s statutory
duty to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable when selling themortgaged property imposed on building societies by section 26 ofthe Building Societies Act 1989. Subsection (1) makes it clear that
this duty applies also to any receiver or other person appointed bythe mortgagee. Subsection (2) imposes a duty to notify the mortgagor
of the outcome of a sale (the mortgagor may sue for damages undersection 105(2) for any loss resulting from a sale below the best price).
Subsection (3) renders it an offence not to serve such notice. Subsec-
tion (4) contains a saving for the general duty of a mortgagee to
account to the mortgagor, which is governed by section 107 .
Section 104 makes provision for giving effect to a sale by a mort-
gagee taking account of the fact that under section 89 the mortgagee
has a charge only and no other title to the property vested in it. Itenables the mortgagee to vest the mortgagor’s estate or interest inthe land in the purchaser without the need for a power of attorney.Subsection (1) makes it clear that these provisions apply to both the
statutory and an express power of sale. Subsection (2) makes it clear
that the vesting of title in the purchaser also extinguishes the mort-gage (but without prejudice to any personal liability of the mortgagorfor any outstanding debt not covered by the sale proceeds). Subsec-
tion (3) deals with cases where there is a sub-mortgage or a mortgage
of part only of a tenancy. Subsection (4) applies the usual rule with
respect to registered land, that the legal title will not vest in thepurchaser until it is registered in the Land Registry.
Section 105 re-enacts the substance of provisions in the Convey-
ancing Acts 1881 and 1911 protecting a purchaser buying the prop-erty from a mortgagee who is professing to exercise the statutorypower of sale.
Section 106 re-enacts the provisions in section 22 of the 1881 Act,
with the modification that the mortgagee’s receipt is now a conclus-
ive, as opposed to sufficient, discharge for the purchaser, unless thepurchaser has actual knowledge of an improper or irregular exerciseof the power of sale, or knowingly participates in such an exercise.Subsection (3) provides that money received by a mortgagee under
the mortgage or from the proceeds of securities comprised in it is tobe applied in the same way as the proceeds of a sale should beapplied under section 107 .
Section 107 re-enacts the provisions in section 21(3) of the 1881
Act governing application of the proceeds of sale, but clarifies them.Subsection (1) sets out the order in which the mortgagee must apply
the proceeds of sale. Subsection (2) specifies what should be done
with any residue of the proceeds after compliance with subsection
(1).Subsection (3) makes it clear that if any residue is passed to other
mortgagees, each of them must comply with subsections (1) and (2).
Subsection (5) clarifies what costs may be met out of the proceeds
of sale.
Section 108 provides for the mortgagee’s statutory power to
appoint a receiver. This was previously governed by provisions in the1881 Act. Subsection (2) confirms the rule that, although appointed
by the mortgagee, the receiver is regarded as agent of the mortgagor.Subsection (4) makes it clear that any power delegated to the
receiver must be exercised in accordance with the provisions in theAct dealing with that power, e.g. sections 100 to107 in relation to
the power of sale.
Section 109 re-enacts, with modifications, the substance of the
provisions in the 1881 Act dealing with application of moneyreceived by a receiver. Subsection (1) makes it clear that the order
of application set out in it must be followed.
Section 110 re-enacts the substance of the provisions in the 1881
Act relating to insurance by the mortgagee of the mortgagedproperty, with the modification in subsection (2) that where the
property is insured, the modern practice of insuring to the fullreinstatement cost of repairing any loss or damage should befollowed.
Section 111 amends the law relating to ‘‘tacking’’ (whereby a mort-
gagee may obtain priority over another mortgagee by attachingpriority to certain loans). It clarifies and simplifies the position relat-ing to future advances on a mortgage and the priority of suchadvances vis-a `-vis other mortgages. Subsection (1) deals with tacking
future advances which is common in banking practice and reflectsthe provision relating to registered land in section 75 of the Regis-tration of Title Act 1964. Subsection (2) defines ‘‘future advances’’
in line with current banking practice and section 75(2) of the 1964Act. Subsection (3) abolishes all other forms of tacking, but saves
existing priorities acquired by tacking. Subsection (4) applies the new
provisions to all mortgages whenever created and provides that thesection does not apply to registered land, which is covered by section75 of the 1964 Act.
Leases and surrenders of leases
Section 112 recasts the provisions in the Conveyancing Acts 1881
and 1911 conferring statutory powers of leasing on mortgagors andmortgagees. Subsection (1) now confers a general power of leasing
on the mortgagor, subject to the mortgagee’s consent (which cannotbe unreasonably withheld). Subsection (2) clarifies the position
where the mortgagor leases without consent — the mortgagee canget the lease set aside only if the lessee had actual knowledge of themortgage at the time of the granting of the lease and if it is preju-dicial to the mortgagee. Subsection (3) now confines the mortgagee’s
power to lease to the listed situations, such as for the purpose ofpreserving the value of the land or protecting the mortgagee’ssecurity.
Section 113 recasts the provisions in the 1881 and 1911 Acts
governing exercise of the power of leasing. Subsections (2) makes it
clear that non-compliance with the provisions in subsection (1)
governing the terms of leases renders the lease totally void. This doesnot apply to the provisions of subsections (3) and (4).
Section 114 recasts the provisions of section 3 of the Conveyancing
Act 1911 dealing with surrender of a lease in order to grant a newlease.
PART 11
JUDGMENT MORTGAGES
(Sections 115 to119)
This Part replaces with substantial modification the provisions of
the Judgment Mortgage (Ireland) Acts 1850 and 1858. Section 115
re-enacts provisions in sections 3 and 4 of the 1858 Act.
3940Section 116 replaces the complicated provisions of section 6 of the
1850 Act relating to registration of judgment mortgages. Subsection
(1)provides that a creditor who has obtained a judgment against
another person has to apply to the Property Registration Authorityto register a judgment mortgage against that person’s estate orinterest in land. It is envisaged that the requirements for registrationwill be prescribed in general rules under the Registration of TitleAct 1964 and the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006. Subsec-
tion (3) clarifies a number of matters upon which there has been
doubt. Paragraph (a) confirms that there is no need to re-register a
judgment mortgage every 5 years. Paragraph (b)(i) confirms that a
creditor may still register a judgment mortgage even though thejudgment debtor has been granted a stay of execution, unless thecourt orders otherwise. Subparagraph (ii) confirms that a judgment
mortgage can be registered against a beneficiary’s interest under atrust for sale, even though the doctrine of conversion deems thatinterest to be personalty. Until actual conversion takes place on asale, the trustees continue to hold the land.
Section 117 replaces the provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the 1850
Act dealing with the effect of registration of a judgment mortgage.Subsection (1) provides that the effect of registering a judgment
mortgage is, firstly, to charge the judgment debtor’s land with thejudgment debt and, secondly, to entitle the judgment mortgagee toapply to court for an appropriate order, including an order undersection 31 in the case of co-owned land. Subsection (2) provides that
the court may make an order for sale of the land or another appro-priate order for enforcement of the judgment mortgage. Subsection
(3)reflects the difference from an ordinary mortgage, i.e. that it is
created by the unilateral action of the judgment creditor and so inthis respect is more like a voluntary conveyance which is subject toprior rights and encumbrances attaching to the land. Subsection (4)
makes it clear that rights and incumbrances to which a judgmentmortgage is subject include claims that had been lodged in courtunder the Family Home Protection Act 1976, the Family Law Act1995 or the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 at the time of regis-tration of the judgment mortgage. Subsection (5) re-enacts the sub-
stance of section 8 of the 1850 Act, substituting a reference to theprovisions in section 74 which replace those in the Conveyancing
Act 1634.
Section 118 re-enacts the substance of section 9 of the 1850 Act
and section 5 of the 1858 Act. Discharge of judgment mortgages ofregistered land is governed by section 65 of the Registration of TitleAct 1964. Section 119 clarifies the operation of section 32 of the Stat-
ute of Limitations 1957 in relation to judgment mortgages.
PART 12
LIS PENDENS
(Sections 120 to126)
Part 12 makes provision for the registration of lis pendens (pending
actions). It updates and streamlines several provisions which are cur-rently contained in statutes dating back to the 19th century and facili-tates the repeal of those provisions.
Section 120 contains relevant definitions for Part 12. Any matter
to be prescribed under Part 12 will be prescribed by rules of court.Section 121 replaces section 10 of the Judgments (Ireland) Act
1844. It makes provision for keeping the register of lis pendens affect-
ing land. Subsection (1) provides that the register will be maintained
in the Central Office of the High Court. Subsection (2) provides that
registration of a lis pendens is permitted in respect of an action in
the Circuit Court in which a claim is made to an estate or interest inland or to have a conveyance of an estate or interest in land declaredvoid. Under subsection (3) , the particulars to be entered on the regis-
ter will be prescribed by rules of court. Subsection (4) provides that
alis pendens registered under section 10 of the Judgments (Ireland)
Act 1844 which has not been vacated before this Act comes intooperation continues to have effect as if that section has not been
repealed. Such a lis pendens shall be deemed to form part of the
register to be maintained under subsection (1) .
Section 122 allows cancellation of an entry of a lis pendens in the
register and replaces section 21 of the Judgments Registry (Ireland)Act 1871. It permits an entry to be cancelled with the consent of theperson on whose application it was registered, or alternatively, onlodgment in the Central Office of the High Court of a notice thatthelis pendens has been vacated by a court order under section 123 .
Section 123 , which updates section 2 of the Lis Pendens Act 1867,
will permit the courts to make an order to vacate a lis pendens in
certain circumstances, including discontinuation or determination ofthe action, unreasonable delay or where the action is not being pros-ecuted bona fide.
Section 124 is a transitional provision. A court may only vacate a
lis pendens registered before the coming into force of this Act on a
ground on which it could have been vacated under the previous law.
Section 125 makes provision for the protection of purchasers where
registration of a lis pendens has not taken place. It re-enacts the
substance of section 5 of the Judgment Mortgage (Ireland) Act 1850.
Section 126 updates the Second Schedule to the Courts and Court
Officers Act 1995 by the insertion of a reference to a court order tovacate a lis pendens under section 123 .
PART 13
AMENDMENTS TO REGISTRATION OF TITLE ACT 1964
(Sections 127 to130)
This Part contains substantial consequential amendments to the
1964 Act. Other minor amendments are set out in Schedule 1 . The
repeal of provisions in the 1964 Act is also provided for in Part 5 ofSchedule 2 .Section 127 adjusts some of the definitions in section 3
of the 1964 Act.
Section 128 remedies a shortcoming in section 25 of the Regis-
tration of Title Act 1964. Sections 23 and 24 of the 1964 Act providefor compulsory registration of title, while section 25 of the same Actdeals with the consequences of non-registration in cases where regis-tration has become compulsory. Section 25 of the 1964 Act was sub-stituted by section 54 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act2006 but that change restricted the consequences of non-registrationto section 24 registrations and overlooked section 23 registrations.The revised text will mean that the consequences of non-registrationwill apply equally to section 23 and section 24 registrations.
4142Section 129 adds a new burden to the list of burdens in section 69
of the 1964 Act which may be registered as affecting registered land,namely a freehold covenant coming within section 48 of this Act.
Section 130 substitutes a new section 71 in the 1964 Act to reflect the
provisions in section 116 of the Act dealing with judgment mortgages.
PART 14
MISCELLANEOUS
(Sections 131 to133)
Section 131 defines the terms ‘‘business’’ and ‘‘lease’’ as having
the same meanings which they have in the Landlord and Tenant(Amendment) Act 1980.
Section 132 deals with rent review clauses in leases. Subsection (1)
specifies that the section applies to a lease of land used wholly orpartly for the purpose of carrying on a business. Subsection (2) makes
it clear, however, that the section does not apply to a business lease,or an agreement for such a lease, which has been entered into priorto the section’s commencement.
Subsection (3) provides that rent review clauses in leases entered
into on or after the commencement of the section are to be construedas providing that the rent payable following review may be fixed atan amount which is less than, greater than or the same as the rentpayable immediately prior to the review date.
Subsection (4) contains two elements. Firstly, it makes it clear that
subsection (3) overrides any provision in a lease or agreement for a
lease which requires that movement in rent be in an upwards onlydirection. Secondly, the subsection confines the scope of the pro-vision to that part of the land in which business is permitted to becarried on under the terms of the lease. This is relevant in the caseof premises used for mixed residential and commercial use.
Section 133 abolishes the power of the sheriff to seize land subject
to a tenancy under a writ of fieri facias , except in relation to a ten-
ancy of land that is used wholly or partly for the purpose of carryingon a business. This simplifies conveyancing of residential propertyby removing the need to make searches in the Sheriff’s Office.
SCHEDULES
Schedule 1 contains various consequential amendments to other
statutes, including the Registration of Title Act 1964.
Schedule 2 contains repeals of numerous pre-1922 statutes falling
into different categories (Parts 1 to 4) and some Acts of theOireachtas (Part 5).
The current statutory provisions relating to land and conveyancing
law are contained in pre-1922 statutes which fall into four categories:
(a) Pre-Union Irish Statutes (enacted by various Irish Parlia-
ments prior to the Act of Union 1800);
(b) Pre-Union English Statutes (enacted by the English Parlia-
ment between 1226 and 1707 and applied to Irelandeither by Poyning’s Act 1495 or by express or impliedprovision);(c) Pre-Union British Statutes (enacted by the British Parlia-
ment between 1708 and 1800 and applied to Ireland);
(d) United Kingdom Statutes (enacted by the Parliament of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between1801 and 1922 and applied to Ireland).
Schedule 3 sets out the different classes of covenants for title
implied in conveyances under sections 80 and 81. Part 1 also specifies
the scope of the covenantor’s liability under the covenants.
