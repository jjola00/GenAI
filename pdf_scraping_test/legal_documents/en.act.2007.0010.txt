2000 so that that Act does not apply to any non-commercial activityor work engaged in by prisoners under the supervision of the gov-ernor or person in charge of the prison. Such activity includes clean-ing or kitchen work, educational, training or work experience activi-ties, the production of goods or services intended to raise funds forcharitable purposes or are provided without charge or with nominalcharge.

to prisoners for goods or services that are not generally available toprisoners including telephone calls, access to electronic devices,private medical treatment or escorts provided outside the prison formatters not related to their imprisonment. Payments by ordeductions from prisoners for such goods or services shall not begreater than the full cost of providing the good or service.
Absence from prison on compassionate, etc., grounds
Section 39 provides that the Minister may on compassionate
grounds, for reason of assessing or facilitating a prisoner’s reinte-gration into society or to allow a prisoner assist in the investigationof an offence, order that a prisoner be taken to a specified person orplace within the State for a specified purpose during a specifiedperiod and return at the end of that period ( subsection (1) ).

Financial Implications
In the light of the Prison Officers Association acceptance of pro-
posals for changes in work practices last year, it is not intended tooutsource prisoner escort services in the foreseeable future. Never-theless the provision is being maintained in case such outsourcingbecame necessary in the future. The financial implications of con-tracting of prisoner escort services cannot be quantified in advanceof a detailed implementation plan being prepared because of the
1314number of variables concerned. However, the intent behind the pro-
vision was to allow the Minister to enter into such agreements wherethey would be more cost effective than the arrangements in place.
There will be some costs associated with providing for prison dis-
ciplinary Appeals Tribunals but it should not be significant.
There will be costs associated with planning permission for new
prisons but it is not possible to quantify such costs in advance as itwill depend on the circumstances of individual cases. However, thecosts should not differ significantly from the costs associated with aplanning application for a similar sized development processed underthe normal planning system.
The establishment of an office of Inspector of Prisons on a statu-
tory basis will not give rise to significant costs as an equivalent postalready exists on a non-statutory basis.
The experience in other countries is that the use of video links
between the courts and prisons results in significant savings as pris-oners do not have to be physically escorted to and from the courts.
The amendments relating to a statutory basis for making charges
and clarifying the position regarding minimum wages legislation areintended to reduce the financial exposure of the Exchequer to poss-ible future claims.
The Bill is deleting the special statutory provision which did not
allow for the closure of Mountjoy ( section 42(b) ). That provision
does not have any intrinsic financial implications although the clos-ure of Mountjoy will free up a valuable site. However, its purpose isto facilitate the replacement of Mountjoy Prison by a new complexinvolving capital expenditure but which will have significantly betterfacilities for prisoners and which will be more cost effective tooperate.
The other amendments have no direct financial implications.
