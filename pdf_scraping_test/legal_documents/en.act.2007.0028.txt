AN BILLE UM ATHCHO ´IRIU´AN DLI ´REACHTU ´IL 2007
STATUTE LAW REVISION BILL 2007
————————
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
TO THE BILL AS PASSED BY
BOTH HOUSES OF THE OIREACHTAS
————————
Introduction
The principal purpose of the Bill is to repeal all public general
statutes enacted before 6th December 1922, with the exception of a‘‘white list’’ of statutes that are specifically preserved.
The statutes repealed by the Bill include a number of Acts of
significant historical interest, such as Poyning’s Act 1495, an Act of1542 providing that the Kings of England shall be Kings of Ireland,the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the Irish Free State(Agreement) Act 1922 and the Irish Free State Constitution Act1922 (Session 2).
The process leading to the Bill attached to this Memorandum
involved a review by the Office of the Attorney General of a totalof 26,370 public general statutes enacted before 1922. This was thefirst comprehensive examination of all statutes enacted before 1922in the history of the State.
Of the 26,370 statutes examined in the Attorney General’s
exercise, 9,219 were already wholly repealed prior to 1 May 2007,and 12,562 were not applicable to Ireland. This left 4,589 statutesstill in force, of which 3,225 are to be repealed by the Bill attachedto this memorandum (these are listed in Schedule 2 ) and 1,364
will be retained for the time being (these are listed in Schedule 1 )
pending a more comprehensive exercise of statute law reform andconsolidation.
Under the Bill, there will be publicly available, for the first time,
a comprehensive and complete list of all pre-1922 public generalstatutes that are retained as part of the law, as set out in Schedule 1.
The Bill is the largest single repealing statute in the history of the
State. It repeals more public general Acts than have been enacted inthe years since 1922 (3,189 public general Acts have been enactedfrom 6 December 1922 to 1 May 2007).
1Click  here  for Act2Provisions of the Bill
Section 1: Definition.
Section 1 interprets ‘‘statute’’ so as to include certain Royal
charters and similar documents, granted or otherwise made beforethe development of the modern parliamentary system, that areregarded by the courts as having the force and effect of an act ofparliament.
Section 2: Statute law revision repeal and saver
Section 2 is the key provision of the Bill. It provides for a funda-
mental clarification and simplification of the statute book by drawinga line at 6 December 1922 and repealing the majority of Acts passedprior to that date. The exceptions are identified in the section.
Subsection (1) repeals all statutes enacted before 6 December 1922
except for the exclusions specified in subsequent provisions.
The first exception in subsection (2)(a) is the Acts specifically
saved, which are listed in Schedule 1 .
The second exception in subsection (2)(b) is for Acts enacted as
or published officially in any series of private, local or personal Acts(or other similar descriptions which combined these terms). Private,local and personal Acts are being retained in force pending a reviewof those Acts in due course. The reference to Acts ‘‘enacted as’’private Acts is intended to cover unpublished private Acts.
An example of a private Act preserved by the Bill is the Act of
1761 incorporating Wilson’s Hospital School in County Westmeath(2 Geo. 3 c. 2P) which will be retained, following the enactment ofthe Bill, by virtue of section 2(2)(b).
Subsection (2)(c) makes clear that the Bill does not affect any sav-
ing or transitional provision made in respect of an Act alreadyrepealed.
Subsection (3) is a partial repeal of the Bill of Rights. While the
main provisions of the Bill of Rights are proposed to be retained forthe time being, a number of other provisions are obsolete and theopportunity is being taken to repeal these provisions, e.g. the pro-vision that guarantees the right to bear arms to Protestants only.
Section 3: Specific repeals.
Section 3 sets out the Acts specifically repealed by the Bill.
Subsection (1) and Schedule 2 list the specific Acts identified in
the course of the review as being unnecessary or as having ceased tobe in force. Acts which clearly never applied to Ireland are notincluded in this list. The section follows the terms of the Statute LawRevision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962 i.e. it is not phrased interms of reference to Acts of particular parliaments.
Subsection (2) is designed to make clear that the omission of an
Act from Schedule 2 does not preserve the Act in force for any pur-
pose except where, as provided in section 2(2)(c), the Act is already
repealed but saving or transitional or continuing provisions havebeen made in respect of the Act.
Subsection (3) is designed to make clear that the inclusion of an
Statute in Schedule 2 is not to be taken to mean that it is of force
and effect but for this Bill — for example, some of the Statutes inSchedule 2, while never repealed, may have been of questionable
constitutionality or application to Ireland. Nonetheless those Statutesare being included for the sake of legal certainty. It should be empha-sised that the presumption of constitutionality does not apply to pre-1937 Statutes and that by formally repealing any such Statute theBill is not seeking to confirm that the Statute is in force. The longtitle makes clear that the Bill (like previous Statute Law RevisionActs) addresses itself to 2 categories of Statutes, those that haveceased to have effect (but have never been formally repealed), andthose that are unnecessary (although technically still in force). Manyof the Statutes listed in Schedule 2 come within the first category,
and are being formally repealed by the Bill for the purposes of cer-tainty and clarity, even though they have ceased to have any, or anypractical, effect.
Section 4: Assignment of short titles.
Section 4 assigns short titles to all public general Acts that are not
being repealed but that do not currently have a short title. Thesection is based on section 1(1) of the Short Titles Act 1962.
Section 5: Amendment of Short Titles Act 1896 .
Section 5 amends the Short Titles Act 1896. The Short Titles Act
1896 provided Short Titles for a large number of English, British andUnited Kingdom statutes. The section will correct two unconven-tional short titles which were conferred by that Act.
Section 6: Amendment of Short Titles Act 1962.
Section 6 amends the Short Titles Act 1962. The Short Titles Act
1962 provided short titles for certain pre-union Irish statutes in theFirst Schedule and certain pre-union English and British statutes inthe Second and Third Schedule. The Act — particularly the Secondand Third Schedules — has become unsatisfactory for a number ofreasons. Firstly the statutes are not arranged in chronological orderand so are inconvenient in terms of acting as a reference source.Secondly the Acts listed in the Schedules to the 1962 Act havelargely been superseded and many of the Acts in the Schedules havebeen repealed since 1962. Thirdly, the list in the Schedules of the1962 Act was not comprehensive, and many Acts which are currentlyin force were not included in those Schedules. Fourthly, in certainareas, the precise citations used in the 1962 Act did not correspondwith the more generally used citations in the Statutes of the Realm
and other HMSO publications.
The opportunity is being taken in the context of a comprehensive
‘‘white list’’ of Statutes being retained in force to assign short titlesto all outstanding Statutes, and the amendment of the 1962 Act andthe 1896 Act is designed to facilitate this. Any citation incompatibilit-ies are being addressed so that the 1962 Act and the 1896 Act asamended, other Acts conferring short titles and this Bill will providea coherent whole by providing short titles for all surviving legislation
for the period in question.
Section 7: Miscellaneous amendments to post-1800 short titles.
Section 7 corrects a number of unconventional short titles con-
ferred by statutes other than the Short Titles Acts of 1896 and 1962.The Leasing Powers Act for Religious Worship in (Ireland) 1855 isan ungrammatical short title and this is changed in the Table, andthe Drainage and Improvements of Lands Supplemental Act(Ireland) 1867 is a case where three Acts have the same short title.The first was 30 & 31Vict. c. 43, the second was 30 & 31 Vict. c. 139and the third was 31 & 32 Vict. 3 The short title of the second needs
34to be amended to add ‘‘No. 2’’ and the third to add ‘‘No. 3’’. The
other amendments relate to inserting a year in the short title of theAct concerned.
Section 8: Evidence of certain early statutes.
Section 8 formally enables certain early statutes to be proved in
court and other legal proceedings by production of a copy of it asreproduced in certain official publications or by production of a copytaken from such a publication and certified by the National Libraryof Ireland or such other libraries or archives as may be designated.The Historic and Municipal Documents of Ireland (HMDI),Calendar of Documents relating to Ireland (CDI) and Public RecordOffice (PRO) volumes are included in the section. Such volumes,while officially published, were not all published by HMSO or theStationery Office and, accordingly, the various DocumentaryEvidence Acts passed between 1845 and 1925 do not appear to applyto all of those volumes. The originals of many of these early statutesare in London or were lost with the passage of time or the destruc-tion in 1922 of the Public Record Office in Dublin. Subsection (1)(b)
and (2)allows a procedure for proof of copy extracts from such
volumes and subsection (3) permits specified institutions to impose a
charge for providing such copy extracts.
Section 9: Savings.
Section 9 provides for savings. The section is based on section 2 of
the Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union) Act 2005 and its provisionsare largely in standard form in Acts of this nature. For clarity,reference has also been inserted to the ‘‘application’’ of statutes tothe State, in order to ensure that the saver clause is wide enoughto preserve statutes which have been applied to Ireland by statutesrepealed by this Bill, for example statutes applied by Poyning’s Act1495. Specific additional provisions are also included to deal withissues that arose during the drafting process, particularly the questionof preserving any extant orders under the Government of IrelandAct 1920 and the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922.
Section 10: Short title and collective citation.
Section 10 provides a short title and a collective citation for the
Short Titles Acts.
Schedule 1
Schedule 1 as stated above lists the Statutes retained. Each part of
Schedule 1 lists the Statutes which it is considered are not appro-priate for repeal at this stage and are being retained in force specifi-cally. The format of the Schedule is based on the Schedules to theShort Titles Act 1962 with the addition of a new column to set outthe existing short title for information. Each Statute in column 1 hasan entry for information in column 2 and also a short title specifiedin either column 3 or 4 but not both. Column 3 reflects any amend-ments to existing short titles made by the Bill.
Schedule 2
Schedule 2 lists the specific Statutes identified in the course of the
review as appropriate for repeal at this stage because they haveceased to be in force or have become unnecessary. These Statutesare not saved by the Bill and thus will be formally repealed followingenactment of this Bill.Financial Implications
There are no Exchequer costs, staffing or other implications
flowing from the enactment of the Bill, and the enactment of the Billwill produce savings in legal and business costs overall.
