(7) At a preliminary hearing under subsection (6) , the Court may
direct that notice of the application shall be given to any otherperson.

and other relevant matters, that —
(a) it is unlikely that the sum secured by the charge would be
recovered were the land to be sold within 3 months afterthe application, and
(b) there is no reasonable prospect of the chargor redeeming
the charge concerned,
the Court shall make an order (in this Part referred to as a “vesting
order ”) vesting in NAMA, or a NAMA group entity nominated by
NAMA, the interest of the chargor, subject to any undertaking undersection 152(2) , in the land concerned.

chargee, in the order of their priority, whichever is thelesser of —
(i) the amount secured by its charge, and
(ii) the value or the remainder of the value, as the case
requires.
155.—(1) Notwithstanding any other enactment or rule of law, a
vesting order —

entity nominated by NAMA for that purpose,

be applied in reduction of the debt secured by the relevant charge.
(3) The debt or debts owed by the chargor to NAMA or the
NAMA group entity shall be reduced by the extent, if any, to whichthe value (within the meaning given by section 154 ) of the charged

Registration Authority under the Registration of Title Act 1964 andthe Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006. The Property Regis-tration Authority shall cause NAMA or the nominated NAMAgroup entity, as the case requires, to be registered as owner of theland in accordance with the order.
(5) For the avoidance of doubt, the making of a vesting order in
relation to land does not impose on NAMA or any NAMA groupentity any obligation to sell the land within any particular period orat all.
156.—(1) The title of a purchaser from NAMA or a NAMA
group entity of land in relation to which NAMA has obtained a vest-ing order is not impeachable on the ground of any irregularity in thevesting order or any irregularity or impropriety in the obtaining of it.
