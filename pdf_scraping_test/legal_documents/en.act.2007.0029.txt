1Click  here  for Act2Amendment of section 1 of Act of 1997
Section 5 amends section 1 of the Bail Act 1997 which provides the
necessary definitions for the 1997 Act. It provides for the additionaldefinitions of ‘‘authorised person’’, ‘‘Minister’’ and ‘‘prescribed’’.These are necessitated by the amendments to the 1997 Act in sub-sequent sections of this Act.
Statement by applicants for bail charged with serious offences
Section 6 provides for a person who is charged with a serious
offence as specified in the Schedule to the Bail Act 1997 to providea signed written statement as part of his of her application for bail.The information to be contained in the statement concerns his or heroccupations, sources of income, property, criminal record includingany offences committed while on bail previously and any previousapplications for bail. The requirement for the statement can be dis-pensed with in certain circumstances. It is an offence to knowinglyprovide false or misleading information. To avoid prejudice to theapplicant’s right to a fair trial the court may prohibit publication ofinformation relating to the statement. Publication in breach of sucha prohibition is a criminal offence.
Evidence in applications for bail under section 2
Section 7 provides that the opinion of a member of the Garda
Sı´ocha´na not below the rank of chief superintendent that refusal of
bail is reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of a seriousoffence by the applicant for bail is admissible as evidence before acourt hearing an application for bail by a person charged with aserious offence (as defined in the Schedule to the Bail Act 1997).

Amendment of section 5 of Act of 1997
Section 8 amends section 5 of the Bail Act 1997. The amendments
are consequential on amendments to section 22 of the Criminal Pro-cedure Act 1967 (see section 18). The purpose of the amendments isto provide for recognisances which need not include monetaryconditions.
Amendment of section 6 of Act of 1997
Section 9 amends section 6 of the Bail Act 1997. The purpose of
the amendment is to remove the requirement that the applicant beof good behaviour as a condition of a recognisance. The requirementthat the applicant not commit an offence while on bail remains. Inaddition, the section provides that a recognisance include notificationto the applicant of the possibility of seeking a variation of a conditionof the recognisance.
Application of section 6 in relation to certain appellants
Section 10 inserts a new section 6A in the Bail Act 1997. The pur-
pose is to allow the court, when admitting a person who is appealinga sentence of imprisonment imposed by the District Court to bail, tomake the recognisance subject to a wider range of conditions than isavailable at present. In addition to the conditions that must beimposed i.e. that the appellant prosecute the appeal, attend court asrequired and not commit an offence while on bail, the court maychoose from the conditions set out in section 6(1)(b) of the 1997 Act.
Electronic monitoring of certain persons admitted to bail
Section 11 inserts a new section 6B in the Bail Act 1997. It allows
the court to make a recognisance subject to the condition that theperson be monitored electronically. This possibility will be availableto the court where: (i) a person charged with a serious offence is tobe admitted to bail or a person is appealing a sentence of imprison-
ment imposed by the District Court; and (ii) the court considers thatit is appropriate to impose conditions that the person reside orremain in a particular district or place in the state or that the personrefrain from attending at certain premises or other places. Where arecognisance is made subject to a condition as to electronic monitor-ing an ‘‘authorised person’’ will be responsible for monitoringcompliance.
Evidence of electronic monitoring

section 6C is a standard provision concerning the admissibility ofdocumentary evidence in proceedings relating to a breach of an elec-tronic monitoring condition.
Arrangements for electronic monitoring
Section 13 inserts a new section 6D in the Bail Act 1997. New
Section 6D allows the Minister, with the consent of the Minister forFinance, to enter into such arrangements including contractualarrangements, as he or she considers appropriate for the operationof electronic monitoring.
Amendment of section 8 of Act of 1997
Section 14 amends section 8 of the Bail Act 1997. These amend-
ments are consequential on the amendments to section 22 of theCriminal Procedure Act 1967 (see section 18) which provide that
recognisances do not need to contain monetary conditions.
Estreatment of recognisance and forfeiture of moneys paid into court
Section 15 substitutes section 9 of the Bail Act 1997. The main
purpose of this substitution is to provide that estreatment of recogni-sances is at the discretion of the court. In addition, the substitutedtext expands the options available to the court where a condition ofa recognisance is breached by allowing, inter alia , for the appoint-
ment of a receiver. The substitution also provides for a warrant ofcommittal to issue where a court order as to estreatment or forfeitureetc is not complied with rather than the current enforcement pro-cedure of distress warrants which authorise the Gardaı ´to seize
goods etc.
Regulations
Section 16 inserts a new section 11A in the Bail Act 1997. This is
a standard provision empowering the Minister to make regulationsprescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in the Bail Actor for the purpose of enabling any provision of the Bail Act to havefull effect.
Amendment of Schedule to Act of 1997
Section 17 makes a number of amendments to the Schedule to the
Bail Act 1997. The Schedule lists the offences that are to be regardedas ‘‘serious offences’’ for the purposes of the Bail Act. The amend-ments update the Schedule having regard to amendments to the Fire-arms Acts 1925 to 2006 introduced by means of the Criminal JusticeAct 2006.
Amendment of section 22 of Act of 1967
Section 18 amends section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967.
The purpose of this amendment is to provide that recognisances neednot contain a condition as to the payment of moneys into court — itbecomes a matter for the court to determine having regard to thecircumstances of the case, including the means of the person and thenature of the offence in relation to which the person is in custody.
34Amendment of section 28 of Act of 1967
Section 19 amends section 28 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967
in order to provide that the prosecution may appeal to the HighCourt against a decision in relation to bail. At present only the appli-cant may appeal. In addition, the amendment provides that the HighCourt may transfer its appeal function in certain circumstances tothe Circuit Court (i.e. when the case is triable by the Circuit Court)where the appellant has been remanded in custody by the DistrictCourt.
Amendment of section 31 of Act of 1967
Section 20 amends section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967.
The purpose of the amendment is to provide that release on bail incertain cases by a member of the Garda Sı ´ocha´na does not need to
be conditioned on payment of moneys.
Amendment of section 68 of Children Act 2001
Section 21 amends section 68 of the Children Act 2001. The pur-
pose of the amendment is to provide that release on bail in certaincases by a member of the Garda Sı ´ocha´na does not need to be con-
ditioned on payment of moneys.
Amendment of section 11(1) of Act of 1984
Section 22 amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.
Section 11 provides that a sentence for an offence committed whilea person is on bail should be consecutive on the sentence for theoriginal offence. The purpose of the amendment is to address ananomaly whereby an offence committed by a person who is unlaw-fully at large following the revocation of bail does not at presentattract the consecutive sentence requirement. The amendmentaddresses this point.
Amendment of section 13 of Act of 1984
Section 23 amends section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 in
two respects. Section 13 creates the offence of failure to surrenderbail. The section is amended in order to increase the maximum finethat may be imposed from £1,000 to \5,000. This is a summary
offence and as such must be prosecuted within 6 months. The pur-pose of the second amendment proposed is to disapply section 10(4)of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 and provide instead thatprosecutions may be taken within 12 months.
PART 3
SENTENCING
Part 3 provides for new sentencing arrangements for certain categ-
ories of offences, in particular those offences that are considered tobe linked to organised crime; introduces post-release orders to beknown as ‘‘monitoring orders’’ and ‘‘protection of persons orders’’;and amends the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962.
Interpretation (Part 3)
Section 24 provides for how the terms ‘‘imprisonment’’, ‘‘prison’’,
‘‘sentence of imprisonment’’ and ‘‘remission from the sentence’’ areto be construed for the purposes of Part 3. It also provides that refer-ences to offences specified in Schedule 2 to the Act shall includereferences to participation as accomplices and references to inchoateoffences (attempts, etc.)Commission of another offence within specified period
Section 25 introduces new sentencing requirements where a person
who has been convicted on indictment of an offence in Schedule 2and, within 7 years of the first conviction, commits another offencein Schedule 2. In such cases the court must impose a sentence forthe subsequent offence that is at least three quarters of the maximumsentence stipulated under the law for that offence unless to do sowould be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case. Inorder for this section to apply a number of criteria must be met:
 the person must be 18 years or more; the conviction for which the person is being sentenced must be
a conviction on indictment for an offence specified in Schedule2 to the Act;
 the person must previously have been convicted on indictment
of one of the offences specified in the Schedule and been sen-tenced to 5 years or more imprisonment; and
 the offence for which the person is being sentenced must have
been committed within 7 years from the date of conviction forthe previous offence (excluding any period of imprisonment) orcommitted during the period of imprisonment for the firstoffence.
Where the maximum sentence is life imprisonment the court must
specify a sentence of at least 10 years imprisonment.

‘‘monitoring order’’ and a ‘‘protection of persons order’’. The courtmay make a ‘‘monitoring order’’ requiring the offender to notify inwriting the inspector of the Garda Sı ´ocha´na of the district in which
the offender’s home is located, of the offender’s address, change ofaddress, or any proposed absence for a period of more than 7 daysfrom his or her home. The court may make a ‘‘protection of personsorder’’ in relation to the offender for the purpose of protecting thevictim of the offence concerned or any other person named in theorder from harassment or intimidation by the offender while theorder is in force. Both orders are activated on the release of theoffender from prison. The orders may last for a period not exceeding7 years. Provision is made for the variation or revocation of theorder.

PART 4
INFERENCES TO BE DRAWN IN CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
Part 4 amends existing provisions relating to the drawing of infer-
ences from a failure or refusal to account for circumstances whichclearly call for same in order to improve their operation; expands
the circumstances in which inferences may be drawn in proceedingsfrom a failure to mention particular facts; and provides for the mak-ing of Ministerial regulations in relation to the administration of cau-tions by members of the Garda Sı ´ocha´na to detained persons. A
range of safeguards are provided.
56Inferences from failure or refusal to account for objects, marks, etc.
Section 28 substitutes section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.
Section 18 currently provides for the drawing of inferences in pro-ceedings for an arrestable offence from the failure or refusal of anaccused to account for objects, marks etc when requested to accountfor same on being questioned or charged by the arresting memberof the Garda Sı ´ocha´na. The purpose of the substituted text is to
improve the operation of the section (i.e. henceforth, the question
may be put to the suspect by any garda not just the arrestingmember) and also to explicitly provide for certain safeguards. Forexample, it will not be possible to convict on an inference alone,without corrorboration or to draw an inference unless the accusedwas cautioned in clear language and was afforded a reasonableopportunity to consult a solicitor before such failure or refusaloccurred. Furthermore the provision will not apply in relation toquestioning in Garda custody unless the interview is recorded or theperson consents in writing to it not being recorded.
Inferences from failure or refusal to account for accused’s presence at
a particular place
Section 29 substitutes section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.
Section 19 currently provides for the drawing of inferences in pro-ceedings for an arrestable offence from the failure or refusal of anaccused to account for his or her presence at a particular place whenrequested to account for same on being questioned or charged bythe arresting member of the Garda Sı ´ocha´na. As with section 28 the
purpose of the substituted text is to improve the operation of thesection and also to explicitly provide for certain safeguards.
Inferences from failure of accused to mention particular facts
Section 30 inserts a new section 19A in the Criminal Justice Act
1984. The purpose of the new section is to provide for the circum-stances in which inferences may be drawn in any subsequent pro-ceedings from a failure by an accused to mention particular factswhen questioned by Gardaı ´or when being charged with an
arrestable offence.
The safeguards included in sections 18 and 19 of the 1984 Act are
replicated in this section.
Given that this new section deals with all arrestable offences,
sections 5 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998and section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996are to be repealed, since those sections deal only with particularoffences — see section 3 and Schedule 1 to the Act.
Amendment of section 2 of Offences Against the State (Amendment)
Act 1998
Section 31 amends section 2 of the Offences against the State
(Amendment) Act 1998 in order to align its inference drawing pro-vision with amended sections 18 and 19 and new section 19A of the1984 Act.
Regulations
Section 32 provides for the making of Ministerial regulations in
relation to the administration of cautions by members of the GardaSı´ocha´na to detained persons. The regulations may include provision
for the forms of caution to be administered to a person in differentcircumstances and in different classes of cases, and the proceduresthat are to apply where a caution has to be withdrawn and a differentcaution administered.PART 5

10 years mandatory minimum sentencing arrangements for certaindrug trafficking offences. The purpose of this substitution is twofold:(i) to represent the amended subsections together and remove thesomewhat opaque subsections (3CC), (3CCC) etc arising from pre-vious amendments, and (ii) by means of subsection (3D)(a) toinclude what may be seen as a ‘‘construction clause’’ in order toset out clearly the purpose of the mandatory minimum sentencingarrangements in section 27.
